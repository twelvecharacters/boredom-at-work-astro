**Reading Time:** 15 minutes

Complete guide to upgrading your home office. Covers the four pillars of a great desk setup: chair, desk, monitor position, and cable management. Includes budget breakdowns and priority order.

**The upgrade priority order:**
1. Chair (biggest health impact) — $400-1,400
2. Monitor arm (neck strain prevention) — $40-180
3. Standing desk (healthy movement) — $500-700
4. Cable management (clean look) — $50-80

**Setup examples:**
