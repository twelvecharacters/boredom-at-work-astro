faq:
  - question: "What is the best free dividend tracker app?"
    answer: "Stock Events is the best free dividend tracker. The free tier tracks up to 15 holdings, shows dividend calendars, payment history, and basic income projections. For most beginners, that's enough. If you have more than 15 holdings, Sharesight's free plan covers up to 10 holdings with better tax reporting features. Your brokerage app (Fidelity, Schwab) also shows upcoming dividends for free — just without the specialized tracking features."
  - question: "Do I need a separate app to track dividends?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Your brokerage app already shows upcoming dividends, recent payments, and basic yield information. A dedicated dividend tracker adds value when you want forward income projections, DRIP tracking, dividend growth analysis, or tax reporting across multiple accounts. If you have investments at only one brokerage and just want to see what's coming, your broker's built-in tools are fine."
  - question: "What is a good dividend yield for a portfolio?"
    answer: "A diversified portfolio typically yields 2-4% from dividends. The S&P 500 average dividend yield is around 1.3% (as of early 2026). Dividend-focused portfolios (REITs, utilities, dividend aristocrats) can yield 3-5%. Anything significantly above 5% is a red flag — extremely high yields often signal a stock whose price has fallen sharply, which can indicate financial trouble. Sustainable dividend growth matters more than current yield."

There's a specific kind of satisfaction in watching dividend payments hit your account. It's not life-changing money (yet). It's $3.47 from Apple, $12.80 from a REIT, $0.63 from some ETF you forgot you owned. But it adds up. And tracking it is weirdly addictive.

The problem is that your brokerage app shows dividends as an afterthought — buried in transaction history or a basic calendar view. If you want to see your total dividend income, project future payments, track growth over time, or manage dividends across multiple accounts, you need a dedicated tracker.

I tested every dividend tracking app I could find. Some are excellent. Some look pretty but break down once you add more than a few holdings. Here are the seven worth your time.

## 1. Stock Events — Best Overall Free Tracker

**Price:** Free / Pro ~$50/year | **Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

Stock Events has become the go-to dividend tracker, and it earned that spot. The free tier gives you what most people need: a clean dividend calendar, income projections, payment history, and portfolio tracking for up to 15 holdings.

### What You Get (Free)

- **Dividend calendar** showing ex-dates, pay dates, and amounts
- **Income projections** for the next 12 months based on current holdings
- **Portfolio tracking** for up to 15 stocks/ETFs
- **Basic dividend history** and yield tracking

### What Pro Adds (~$6/month)

- Unlimited holdings
- Dividend growth tracking
- Advanced income analytics and charts
- Multiple portfolio support
- CSV import/export

### Why I Like It

The calendar view is the killer feature. At a glance, you see every upcoming dividend — which stocks pay this week, this month, and which months are your highest-income months. It makes dividend investing feel tangible in a way that brokerage apps don't.

The app also handles international dividends well, supporting most major stock exchanges. If you hold US, UK, and European dividend stocks, Stock Events tracks them all in one view.

### Limitations

The 15-holding limit on the free tier is generous but limiting if you have a diversified portfolio. Pro at $6/month is reasonable, but it adds up alongside other subscription tools.

## 2. Sharesight — Best for Tax Reporting

**Price:** Free (10 holdings) / Investor ~$12/mo / Expert ~$24/mo | **Platforms:** Web, iOS, Android

Sharesight is the serious choice. If you care about tax-loss harvesting, cost basis tracking, and year-end tax reports, this is the tool.

### What You Get

- **Automatic dividend tracking** — Sharesight auto-detects dividends from your holdings, no manual entry
- **Tax reports** — Capital gains, dividend income, unrealized gains, tax-loss selling opportunities
- **Performance tracking** — True time-weighted returns including dividends (most brokerages only show price returns)
- **Multi-currency support** — Tracks investments across global exchanges with automatic currency conversion
- **Broker import** — Sync with major brokerages via CSV or direct integration

### Why I Like It

The performance tracking is what sets Sharesight apart. Most tools show you how much your stocks went up or down. Sharesight shows your **total return** — price movement plus reinvested dividends. This is the number that actually matters, and it's surprisingly hard to calculate accurately across multiple accounts and reinvestment events.

The tax reporting alone justifies the price if you're managing a taxable portfolio. At tax time, you export a report instead of spending hours in spreadsheets.

### Limitations

The free tier only covers 10 holdings — not enough for a diversified portfolio. The $12/month Investor plan supports 100+ holdings, which covers most individual investors. The interface is functional rather than beautiful; it's built for data, not aesthetics.

## 3. DivTracker — Best Design (iOS Only)

**Price:** Free (10 holdings) / Pro ~$4/mo ($20/yr) / Ultimate ~$7/mo ($50/yr) | **Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web

DivTracker is what happens when a designer builds a dividend tracker. The app is beautiful — smooth animations, clean typography, and data visualizations that make you want to check your dividends just because the app is nice to use.

### What You Get

- **Visual dividend calendar** with clean monthly/yearly views
- **Income projections** with interactive charts
- **Dividend growth tracking** — see how your income grows over time
- **DRIP simulation** — project income with dividend reinvestment
- **Portfolio allocation pie charts** by sector, holding, and yield

### Why I Like It

The DRIP projection feature is genuinely motivating. Plug in your current portfolio and monthly contribution, and DivTracker shows you where your dividend income will be in 5, 10, 20 years with reinvestment. Watching that compound growth curve steepen is the most effective advertisement for long-term investing I've seen.

### Limitations

The free tier limits you to 10 holdings. The Pro tier adds brokerage account syncing (auto-updates), which makes a huge difference if you don't want to manually enter every trade.

## 4. Simply Wall St — Best Visual Analysis

**Price:** Free (limited) / Premium ~$10/mo | **Platforms:** Web, iOS, Android

Simply Wall St isn't specifically a dividend tracker — it's a portfolio analysis tool with excellent dividend features. The "snowflake" visualization that scores stocks on Value, Growth, Health, Dividends, and Future performance is unique and immediately useful.

### What You Get

- **Snowflake analysis** for every stock (visual scoring across 5 dimensions)
- **Dividend analysis** — yield, payout ratio, coverage, growth history, sustainability score
- **Portfolio health check** — diversification, overexposure, and dividend concentration
- **Dividend sustainability** — flags stocks where dividends may be at risk (high payout ratios, declining earnings)

### Why I Like It

The dividend sustainability analysis is the standout. Instead of just showing you yield (which is what most trackers do), Simply Wall St analyzes whether a company can *maintain* its dividend. High yield means nothing if the company cuts it next quarter. The payout ratio, earnings trend, and cash flow analysis together paint a much clearer picture.

### Limitations

The free tier is quite limited (5 stocks on a watchlist, limited report access). Premium at $10/month gives you full access, but the dividend tracking features are secondary to the analysis tools. If you just want a calendar and income tracking, Stock Events or DivTracker are more focused.

## 5. Snowball Analytics — Best Income Analytics

**Price:** Free (limited features) / Pro ~$80/year | **Platforms:** Web, iOS, Android

Snowball Analytics is built specifically for income investors. While other trackers show you dividends as one feature among many, Snowball makes dividend income the entire focus.

### What You Get

- **Detailed income breakdowns** by month, quarter, year, and holding
- **Dividend growth tracking** with year-over-year comparisons
- **Forward income projections** based on declared dividends
- **Dividend reinvestment tracking** (manual DRIP logging)
- **Sector and geographic allocation** analysis

### Why I Like It

The income analytics go deeper than any other tracker on this list. You can see your dividend income broken down by ordinary vs. qualified dividends, by holding period, and by declared vs. projected. The year-over-year growth chart is particularly useful — it turns abstract portfolio growth into a concrete income trajectory.

### Limitations

The free tier lets you track unlimited holdings but limits historical data and some analytics features. The interface is data-heavy and assumes familiarity with dividend investing concepts — not the most beginner-friendly option.

## 6. Dividend.com — Best for Research

**Price:** Free (basic research) | **Platforms:** Web

Dividend.com isn't a portfolio tracker — it's a dividend research database. But it's so useful for dividend investors that it belongs on this list.

### What You Get

- **Dividend history** for thousands of stocks (payment dates, amounts, increases)
- **Dividend Aristocrat and King lists** — stocks with 25+ and 50+ years of consecutive dividend increases
- **Yield screener** — filter stocks by yield, growth rate, payout ratio, sector
- **Ex-date calendar** — see all upcoming ex-dates across the market
- **Educational content** — articles, guides, and strategy content for dividend investors

### Why I Like It

When you're researching a new dividend stock, Dividend.com is the first place to check. The complete dividend history — every payment, every increase, every cut — tells you more about a company's financial health than any single metric. A stock that's raised its dividend for 30 consecutive years sends a very different signal than one with an erratic payment history.

### Limitations

It's a research tool, not a portfolio tracker. You can't import your holdings or track your personal income. Use it alongside Stock Events or Sharesight, not instead of them.

## 7. Your Brokerage App — The One You Already Have

**Price:** Free | **Platforms:** Whatever your broker offers

Before you download anything, check what your brokerage already provides. Most major brokerages have improved their dividend features significantly.

### What You Get (Varies by Broker)

| Broker | Dividend Calendar | Income History | Projections | DRIP |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Fidelity | ✅ | ✅ | Basic | ✅ Auto-DRIP |
| Schwab | ✅ | ✅ | Basic | ✅ Auto-DRIP |
| Vanguard | ✅ | ✅ | Limited | ✅ Auto-DRIP |
| Robinhood | Basic | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (recent) |

### Why Consider This First

If you have all your investments at one brokerage, the built-in tools might be enough. You get dividend calendars, payment history, and automatic DRIP without another app or subscription. The data is always accurate because it's coming directly from your account — no manual entry or sync issues.

### When to Add a Dedicated Tracker

- You have accounts at **multiple brokerages** and want a unified view
- You want **forward income projections** beyond what your broker shows
- You want **dividend growth analytics** and year-over-year comparisons
- You need **tax reporting** features your broker doesn't provide

---

## Which Tracker Should You Choose?

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Just starting with dividends | Your brokerage app + Dividend.com for research |
| Want a free dedicated tracker | Stock Events (free, 15 holdings) |
| iOS user who values design | DivTracker (beautiful, DRIP projections) |
| Tax season stress | Sharesight (automated tax reports) |
| Deep income analytics | Snowball Analytics (web only) |
| Visual portfolio analysis | Simply Wall St (snowflake scores) |
| All-in-one research | Dividend.com + Stock Events combo |

**My setup:** Stock Events (free) for daily tracking and calendar, Dividend.com for research, and Sharesight when tax season approaches. This combo costs $0 for 10 months and ~$12/month for the two months I need tax reports.

---

## The Dividend Investor's Quick Start

1. **Track what you have:** Add your dividend holdings to Stock Events or your brokerage's dividend view
2. **Know your income:** Calculate your current annual dividend income
3. **Set a goal:** Pick a monthly income target ($100/month? $500/month?)
