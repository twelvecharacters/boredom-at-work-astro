faq:
  - question: "Are monitor arms worth it?"
    answer: "Yes, if you value desk space, ergonomics, or have multiple monitors. A monitor arm frees up your entire desk footprint, lets you position the screen at perfect eye level, and makes it easy to switch between sitting and standing. Even a $40 arm makes a noticeable difference. Premium arms ($150+) last 10+ years."
  - question: "How much weight can a monitor arm hold?"
    answer: "Budget arms ($30-50) typically hold 15-22 lbs. Mid-range arms ($50-120) hold 20-25 lbs. Premium arms like the Ergotron LX hold 7-25 lbs with better stability. Most 27-inch monitors weigh 8-15 lbs, so even budget arms work for standard monitors. Check your monitor's weight before buying."
  - question: "What size monitor can a monitor arm hold?"
    answer: "Most monitor arms support 13-32 inch screens. Premium arms like Ergotron support up to 34 inches (including ultrawides). The limiting factor is usually weight, not size. A 32-inch monitor typically weighs 15-20 lbs, which mid-range and premium arms handle easily."
  - question: "Single arm vs dual arm—which should I get?"
    answer: "Get a dual arm if you have two monitors and want them at the same height with synchronized movement. Get two single arms if you want independent positioning for each monitor or plan to add a second monitor later. Two singles cost more but offer more flexibility."
  - question: "Do all monitors work with monitor arms?"
    answer: "Most monitors made after 2010 have VESA mounting holes (75x75mm or 100x100mm) on the back. Check your monitor's specs before buying. Some budget monitors and iMacs don't have VESA mounts—you'll need an adapter ($15-30) or a specialized arm."
  - question: "Clamp mount vs grommet mount—which is better?"
    answer: "Clamp mount attaches to the edge of your desk—no drilling required, easy to move. Grommet mount goes through a hole in your desk—more stable, cleaner look, but permanent. Most arms include both options. Use clamp unless you have a thin desk (<0.5 inch) or want maximum stability."
tldr: "Get the Ergotron LX (~$179) for the best quality and 10-year warranty. Budget pick: VIVO Premium Aluminum (~$40) handles most monitors well. For dual monitors, the VIVO Dual (~$45) offers unbeatable value. All prices as of March 2026."

## Monitor Arm Setup Tips

### Before You Buy

1. **Weigh your monitor** — Check specs or use a bathroom scale
2. **Check VESA compatibility** — Look for 4 holes in a square pattern on the back
3. **Measure desk thickness** — Most clamps work with 0.5-2.5" thick desks
4. **Consider cable length** — Arm movement requires slack in cables

### Installation Tips

| Step | Tip |
|------|-----|
| **Placement** | Position near back of desk for best range |
| **Tighten properly** | Clamp should be snug, not crushing the desk |
| **Adjust tension** | Set so monitor stays put without drifting |
| **Route cables** | Use arm's cable management before connecting |

### Ergonomic Setup

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Monitor height** | Top of screen at or slightly below eye level |
| **Distance** | Arm's length away (~20-26 inches) |
| **Tilt** | Slight backward tilt (10-20°) |
| **Position** | Centered in front of you, not off to the side |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring weight limits** — A sagging arm is worse than the original stand

2. **Forgetting desk thickness** — Some clamps don't fit thin IKEA desks

3. **No VESA check** — Some monitors (older iMacs, budget panels) need adapters

4. **Skipping cable slack** — Tight cables limit movement and cause damage

5. **Over-tightening** — Can damage desk edge or strip threads

6. **Wrong height** — Monitor too high causes neck strain

---

## The Bottom Line

For most people, the **VIVO Premium Aluminum** at ~$40 is the smart choice. It handles typical monitors well and costs less than a nice lunch.

If you want the best and plan to use it for years, the **Ergotron LX** at ~$179 is worth the investment—the 10-year warranty alone justifies the price.

For dual monitors on a budget, the **VIVO Dual** at ~$45 is unbeatable value.

Whatever you choose, even a basic monitor arm dramatically improves your desk setup. Free up that space, get your screen at the right height, and enjoy a cleaner workspace.
