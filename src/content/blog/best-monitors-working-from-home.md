faq:
  - question: "Is a 27-inch or ultrawide monitor better for working from home?"
    answer: "A 27-inch 4K monitor is better if you have a smaller desk, want a dual-monitor setup, or need to keep costs under $500. An ultrawide (34 inches or larger) is better if you multitask heavily, want to replace two monitors with one seamless screen, and have at least 48 inches of desk space. Ultrawides eliminate the bezel gap in dual setups and look cleaner, but cost more and can feel overwhelming for simple tasks like email."
  - question: "Do I need USB-C on my work monitor?"
    answer: "If you use a laptop, yes—USB-C with Power Delivery is a game-changer. It charges your laptop and carries the video signal through a single cable, eliminating the need for a separate charger and display cable. Look for at least 65W PD (charges most ultrabooks) or 90W+ PD (charges larger laptops like 15-inch MacBook Pros). If you use a desktop PC, USB-C is nice but not essential since you'll use DisplayPort or HDMI anyway."
  - question: "How much should I spend on a work-from-home monitor?"
    answer: "For most remote workers, $330-420 gets you an excellent 27-inch 4K monitor with USB-C. Budget picks around $240 still deliver sharp 4K resolution but may lack USB-C and hub features. Premium monitors ($680-1,020) add Thunderbolt docking, IPS Black panels with deeper contrast, or ultrawide screen real estate. If your employer offers a home office stipend, the $500-700 range offers the best balance of features and quality."

I've been working from home for years, and the monitor is the single biggest upgrade you can make to your WFH setup. Not the chair, not the desk—the screen you stare at for 8+ hours every day.

But the market is overwhelming. 27-inch or ultrawide? IPS or IPS Black? Do you actually need Thunderbolt? And is a $700 monitor really three times better than a $280 one?

I dug into the specs, read through dozens of reviews, and compared the most recommended monitors for productivity work. Here are the 7 best options for every budget and use case.

## 27-Inch vs Ultrawide: Which One Should You Get?

Before we get into individual picks, let's settle the biggest question first.

### Go with a 27-inch 4K if you:

- Have a desk under 48 inches wide
- Want to run dual monitors later (two 27s side by side is a popular setup)
- Prefer a tighter, more focused workspace
- Want to keep your budget under $500
- Need to match an existing monitor

### Go ultrawide (34"+) if you:

- Multitask constantly—spreadsheets next to Slack next to a browser
- Hate the bezel gap between two monitors
- Have at least 48 inches of desk width
- Do any kind of video editing, data analysis, or design work
- Want a cleaner desk with fewer cables

For most WFH workers doing typical office tasks—email, docs, video calls, spreadsheets—a single 27-inch 4K monitor is the sweet spot. If you're a power user who lives in multiple windows, an ultrawide will change how you work.

Either way, pair your monitor with a [good monitor arm](/best-monitor-arms/) to free up desk space and nail the ergonomics.

## The 7 Best Monitors for Working From Home

### 1. Dell UltraSharp U2725QE — Best Overall

**~$680 | 27" 4K | IPS Black | Thunderbolt 4 (140W PD)**

The Dell U2725QE is the best monitor you can buy for working from home, period. It's the world's first 27-inch 4K monitor with a 3000:1 contrast ratio thanks to its IPS Black panel—which means blacks actually look black instead of the washed-out gray you get on regular IPS screens.

**What makes it special:**

- **IPS Black panel** with 3000:1 contrast ratio (3x better than standard IPS)
- **Thunderbolt 4** with 140W Power Delivery—charges even 16-inch MacBook Pros at full speed
- **120Hz refresh rate**—makes scrolling and window management noticeably smoother than 60Hz
- **Full hub functionality**: 5 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, RJ45 Ethernet, DisplayPort out for daisy-chaining
- **KVM switch** built in—switch between two computers with one keyboard and mouse

The U2725QE is essentially a Thunderbolt dock with a gorgeous screen attached. One cable from your laptop gives you power, video, Ethernet, and access to all your USB peripherals. That alone justifies the price if you're tired of dongle hell.

**Who it's for:** Remote workers who want the best image quality and single-cable laptop docking. The $680 price is steep, but you're getting a monitor that replaces a $200+ Thunderbolt dock.

---

### 2. Dell Pro P2725QE — Best Value USB-C Hub

**~$420 | 27" 4K | IPS | USB-C (90W PD)**

If the U2725QE is overkill for your needs, the P2725QE delivers 90% of the experience at a lower price. You lose the IPS Black panel (it's standard IPS with 1500:1 contrast instead of 3000:1) and the Thunderbolt 4 (it's USB-C instead), but you still get an excellent 4K display with full hub features.

**What you get:**

- **27-inch 4K** IPS panel with 100Hz refresh rate
- **90W USB-C Power Delivery**—enough for most ultrabooks and 13/14-inch laptops
- **Hub ports**: 3 USB-A downstream, 1 USB-C downstream, RJ45 Ethernet
- **Great color accuracy** right out of the box
- **Fully adjustable stand**: height, tilt, swivel, pivot

The P2725QE is the workhorse monitor. It doesn't have the wow factor of the U2725QE's contrast ratio, but for spreadsheets, documents, and video calls, you won't notice the difference. The 90W USB-C is plenty for most work laptops—just note it won't fully power larger 15/16-inch laptops under heavy load.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who wants a solid 4K USB-C hub monitor without paying the Thunderbolt premium. This is the smart choice for most people.

### 3. ASUS ProArt PA279CRV — Best for Color Accuracy

**~$400 | 27" 4K | IPS | USB-C (96W PD)**

If you do any design, photography, or video work alongside your regular office tasks, the ProArt PA279CRV is the monitor to get. It's factory-calibrated to Delta E < 2 (meaning colors are essentially indistinguishable from the real thing) and covers 99% of both DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces.

**Why designers love it:**

- **99% DCI-P3 and 99% Adobe RGB**—covers virtually every color space you'd need
- **Factory calibrated** with Delta E < 2 and Calman Verified
- **96W USB-C Power Delivery**—charges your laptop while you work
- **Daisy-chain support**—connect a second monitor through DisplayPort out
- **3-year warranty** with zero bright dot guarantee

At ~$400, this monitor is absurdly good value for the color accuracy you get. Competing monitors with this level of calibration (like the BenQ SW series) cost $600+.

The trade-off? It's "only" 60Hz, which is fine for productivity but less smooth for scrolling compared to the 100-120Hz Dell options. And the contrast ratio (1000:1) is standard IPS—not as punchy as the Dell U2725QE's IPS Black panel.

**Who it's for:** Photographers, designers, and anyone who works with color-critical content. Also a great pick if you just want a well-calibrated monitor at an excellent price.

### 4. Samsung ViewFinity S80UD — Best Mid-Range

**~$330 | 27" 4K | IPS | USB-C (90W PD)**

Samsung's ViewFinity S80UD sits in the sweet spot between the budget Dell S2725QS and the premium Dell monitors. You get 4K, 90W USB-C, a built-in KVM switch, and HDR10 support—all for around $330.

**Key features:**

- **4K UHD** with HDR10 and 1.07 billion colors
- **90W USB-C Power Delivery**—one cable for video and charging
- **Built-in KVM switch**—great if you switch between a work laptop and personal machine
- **Ergonomic stand** with full height/tilt/swivel/pivot adjustment
- **Anti-glare coating** that handles bright home office windows well

The S80UD doesn't have the hub connectivity of the Dell P2725QE (fewer downstream USB ports), but it compensates with the KVM switch and solid build quality. Samsung's panel calibration is good out of the box—not ProArt-level, but more than adequate for office work.

**Who it's for:** Remote workers who want USB-C Power Delivery and a KVM switch without spending $500+. A solid middle-ground pick.

### 5. Dell S2725QS — Best Budget 4K

**~$240 | 27" 4K | IPS | No USB-C**

Here's a secret: you don't need to spend $500+ to get a great WFH monitor. The Dell S2725QS proves it. For ~$240, you get a genuine 4K IPS panel with 120Hz refresh rate, 99% sRGB coverage, and that clean Dell build quality.

**What you get for the money:**

- **4K resolution at 120Hz**—sharper text and smoother scrolling than most $500 monitors from two years ago
- **1500:1 contrast ratio**—better than many monitors at twice the price
- **99% sRGB** color coverage
- **AMD FreeSync Premium**—bonus if you game after hours
- **Integrated speakers** (basic but functional for video calls)

**What you don't get:** USB-C connectivity (HDMI and DisplayPort only), no downstream USB ports, and no KVM switch. You'll need a separate cable for charging your laptop and might need a small USB hub.

The S2725QS is the smartest buy if your employer doesn't offer a home office stipend and you're paying out of pocket. The image quality punches well above its price class. If you want dual monitors on a budget, two of these (~$480 total) gives you more screen real estate than a single ultrawide.

**Who it's for:** Budget-conscious WFH workers who prioritize display quality over connectivity features. Also perfect as a second monitor for a dual setup.

### 6. Dell UltraSharp U3425WE — Best Ultrawide

**~$1,020 | 34" Ultrawide | IPS Black | Thunderbolt 4 (90W PD)**

If you've decided ultrawide is the way to go, the Dell U3425WE is the one to get. It takes everything great about the U2725QE—IPS Black panel, Thunderbolt 4 hub, excellent color accuracy—and stretches it across a 34-inch curved 3440x1440 display.

**Why it's the best ultrawide for work:**

- **IPS Black panel** with 2000:1 contrast ratio—noticeably deeper blacks than standard IPS ultrawides
- **98% DCI-P3 coverage**—accurate colors for design and photo work
- **Thunderbolt 4** with 90W PD, plus RJ45 Ethernet, 4 USB-A 3.2, and USB-C downstream
- **120Hz refresh rate**—smooth scrolling across that wide canvas
- **1900R curve** that reduces eye strain when viewing the edges
- **TUV Rheinland 5-star eye comfort** certification—first monitor to achieve this

The 3440x1440 resolution at 34 inches gives you roughly the same pixel density as a 27-inch QHD monitor. Text is sharp, but not as crisp as a 27-inch 4K. For spreadsheets and documents, it's excellent. For photo editing where you need to zoom in on fine detail, the 27-inch 4K picks are slightly better.

**Who it's for:** Power users who want one monitor to replace a dual-monitor setup. Especially great for financial analysts, project managers, developers, and anyone who keeps 3+ windows visible at all times.

### 7. LG 34WQ75C-B — Best Budget Ultrawide

**~$500 | 34" Ultrawide | IPS | USB-C (90W PD)**

The LG 34WQ75C-B makes ultrawide accessible. For around $500, you get a 34-inch curved QHD display with USB-C (90W PD), built-in KVM switch, RJ45 Ethernet, and HDR10 support. That's a lot of features for an ultrawide at this price.

**What stands out:**

- **3440x1440 QHD** on a curved 34-inch panel with 99% sRGB
- **90W USB-C Power Delivery**—single-cable laptop connection
- **RJ45 Ethernet** built in—reliable wired connection without a dongle
- **KVM switch**—share keyboard and mouse between two devices
- **HDR10 support** (entry-level, but better than nothing)
- **Height, tilt, and swivel adjustable** stand

The 60Hz refresh rate is the main compromise. If you're coming from a 120Hz monitor, scrolling will feel less smooth. For typical office work, most people won't notice. The contrast ratio (1000:1) is also standard IPS—not in the same league as the Dell U3425WE's IPS Black panel.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who wants the ultrawide experience without the $800+ price tag. Great for multitasking-heavy workflows where screen real estate matters more than panel tech.

## What About Dual Monitors?

If you're considering a dual 27-inch setup, here are a few things to keep in mind:

- **Two Dell S2725QS monitors** (~$560 total) give you 7680x2160 combined pixels—more total resolution than any single ultrawide. Best budget dual setup.
- **Two Dell P2725QE monitors** (~$1,040 total) with USB-C hub features on both. Overkill—you only need hub features on one monitor, so pair one P2725QE with one S2725QS (~$800 total).
- **Mix and match sizes** only if you don't mind mismatched heights. A 27" + 24" looks awkward without separate [monitor arms](/best-monitor-arms/) to align them.

A good dual-arm mount keeps things tidy. And if you go with any multi-monitor setup, our [cable management guide](/cable-management-tips/) will save you from the spaghetti situation behind your desk.

## Which Monitor Should You Buy?

Here's the quick decision tree:

**Tight budget (under $300)?**
Get the **Dell S2725QS**. It's a genuinely excellent 4K monitor at a price that's hard to argue with. Add a USB-C hub separately if you need one.

**Want the best value USB-C hub monitor?**
The **Dell P2725QE** at ~$420 is the smart pick for most remote workers. One cable, 4K, 90W charging, built-in Ethernet—it covers everything.

**Need color accuracy for creative work?**
The **ASUS ProArt PA279CRV** at ~$400 offers professional-grade calibration at a consumer price. Nothing else comes close at this price point.

**Want a mid-range all-rounder?**
The **Samsung ViewFinity S80UD** at ~$330 balances features and price well, especially with its built-in KVM switch for multi-device users.

**Want the absolute best 27-inch?**
The **Dell U2725QE** at ~$680. IPS Black panel, Thunderbolt 4, and enough ports to replace your dock entirely.

**Going ultrawide?**
The **Dell U3425WE** (~$1,020) if you want the best. The **LG 34WQ75C-B** (~$500) if you want ultrawide without the premium price.

No matter which monitor you choose, the upgrade from a laptop screen to a proper external display is night and day. Your eyes, neck, and productivity will all thank you.
