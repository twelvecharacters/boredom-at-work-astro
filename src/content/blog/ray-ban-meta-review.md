faq:
  - question: "Are Ray-Ban Meta glasses worth $299?"
    answer: "It depends on your use case. For hands-free calls, music, and quick photos, they're excellent. But if you're expecting AR features or all-day battery life, you might be disappointed. They're best for people already wearing glasses who want smart features without extra devices."
  - question: "Can you use Ray-Ban Meta glasses at work?"
    answer: "Yes, they're discreet enough for office use. The speakers are surprisingly good for calls and music without bothering coworkers. However, be mindful of the camera - some workplaces have policies about recording devices."
  - question: "How long does Ray-Ban Meta battery last?"
    answer: "With moderate use (some music, a few calls, occasional photos), I get about 4-5 hours. The charging case provides additional charges, giving you roughly 32 hours total before needing a power outlet."
