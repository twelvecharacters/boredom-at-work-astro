Ever found yourself browsing Japanese auction sites during a slow afternoon at work, wondering how to actually get that vintage camera or limited-edition figure shipped to your doorstep? You're not alone.

Buying from Japan has become increasingly popular, but the process can feel overwhelming. If you're completely new to this, check out our [complete beginner's guide to buying from Japan](/how-to-buy-from-japan-beginners-guide/) first. But if you already know the basics and just need to pick a proxy service, you're in the right place.

The two most popular options are **Buyee** and **Sendico**. But which one should you use? Let's break it down.

## What Are Japan Proxy Services?

A proxy service acts as your middleman in Japan. Here's how it works:

1. You find an item on a Japanese website (Yahoo Auctions, Mercari, Rakuten, etc.)
2. The proxy service purchases it using their Japanese address
3. They receive the item at their warehouse
4. They ship it to you internationally

Simple concept, but the devil is in the details — and that's where Buyee and Sendico differ significantly.

## Buyee vs Sendico: Quick Comparison

| Feature | Buyee | Sendico |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Service Fee** | 300-500 yen + 5-10% | 100-300 yen flat |
| **Supported Sites** | Yahoo Auctions, Mercari, Rakuten, Amazon JP, and 30+ more | Yahoo Auctions, Mercari, Rakuten, smaller selection |
| **Mercari Integration** | Official partnership | Manual URL submission |
| **Package Consolidation** | Yes (500 yen) | Yes (free for first 30 days) |
| **Storage Time** | 30 days free | 45 days free |
| **Interface** | Polished, English-friendly | Functional, some Japanese |
| **Payment Methods** | Credit cards, PayPal, Alipay | Credit cards, PayPal, bank transfer |
| **Best For** | Beginners, heavy users | Budget-conscious buyers |

## Buyee: The Polished Option

### Pros

**Official Partnerships:** Buyee has official integrations with Mercari, Yahoo Auctions, and other major Japanese platforms. This means smoother purchasing and better buyer protection.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Everything is in English, the checkout process is intuitive, and customer support is responsive. If you're new to buying from Japan, Buyee removes most of the friction.

**Shipping Options:** Buyee offers a wide range of shipping methods, from budget surface mail to express DHL. Their volume discounts often make heavy packages cheaper than competitors.

**Consolidation Service:** Combine multiple purchases into one shipment to save on international shipping. This costs 500 yen per package consolidated.

### Cons

**Higher Fees:** Buyee's fee structure can add up quickly. You're looking at a base fee plus a percentage of the item price. For expensive items, this stings.

**Automatic Bidding Markup:** On auctions, Buyee adds their fee to your maximum bid, which can make you less competitive against local Japanese bidders.

## Sendico: The Budget-Friendly Alternative

### Pros

**Lower Fees:** Sendico charges a flat fee per purchase (typically 100-300 yen), regardless of item price. For expensive items, this saves you a lot compared to Buyee's percentage-based system.

**Free Consolidation:** Your first 30 days include free package consolidation. Even after that, consolidation fees are minimal.

**Longer Storage:** 45 days of free storage gives you more flexibility to combine shipments.

**Transparent Pricing:** What you see is what you get. No hidden fees or confusing percentage calculations.

### Cons

**Less Polished Interface:** Sendico works, but it's not as smooth as Buyee. Some parts of the site are still in Japanese, and the learning curve is steeper.

**Fewer Supported Sites:** While Sendico covers the major platforms, it doesn't have the extensive list that Buyee offers.

**Manual Process:** For Mercari purchases, you'll need to copy-paste listing URLs rather than clicking a convenient button.

## Which Sites Can You Buy From?

### Buyee Supports:
- Yahoo Auctions Japan (official partner)
- Mercari Japan (official partner)
- Rakuten
- Amazon Japan
- ZOZOTOWN
- Suruga-ya
- And 30+ more specialty stores

### Sendico Supports:
- Yahoo Auctions Japan
- Mercari Japan
- Rakuten
- Amazon Japan
- Most major Japanese e-commerce sites (via URL submission)

## Real Cost Comparison: A Practical Example

Let's say you want to buy a vintage film camera for 15,000 yen (~$100).

### Buyee Costs:
- Item price: 15,000 yen
- Service fee (5%): 750 yen
- Plan fee: 300 yen
- **Total fees: 1,050 yen (~$7)**

### Sendico Costs:
- Item price: 15,000 yen
- Service fee: 200 yen
- **Total fees: 200 yen (~$1.30)**

For this single item, Sendico saves you about $5.70. Multiply that across several purchases, and the savings add up.

## Shipping Costs: Where It Gets Complicated

Shipping is where both services can surprise you. International shipping from Japan isn't cheap, and rates vary wildly based on:

- Package weight and dimensions
- Destination country
- Shipping speed (surface vs. air vs. express)

**General guidance:**
- **Small, light items (under 500g):** Sendico often cheaper
- **Heavy packages (over 2kg):** Buyee's volume discounts may win
- **Multiple items:** Consolidation at either service saves money

Always check estimated shipping costs before committing to a purchase.

## When to Use Buyee

Choose Buyee if you:
- Are new to buying from Japan and want a smooth experience
- Value customer support and buyer protection
- Plan to buy from niche Japanese stores not supported by Sendico
- Need the convenience of official Mercari/Yahoo integration

## When to Use Sendico

Choose Sendico if you:
- Are comfortable with a slightly steeper learning curve
- Want to minimize fees, especially on expensive items
- Don't mind copy-pasting URLs for Mercari purchases
- Are buying multiple items and want free consolidation

## Pro Tips for Either Service

1. **Consolidate packages** whenever possible. International shipping is expensive, and combining shipments saves money.

2. **Check dimensions, not just weight.** Shipping companies charge by dimensional weight if the package is large but light.

3. **Use surface mail for non-urgent items.** It takes 4-6 weeks but costs a fraction of express shipping.

4. **Set up alerts** for items you want. Both services let you track auctions and get notified.

5. **Read seller ratings.** Just like eBay, check the seller's reputation before bidding.

## The Verdict

**For beginners:** Start with Buyee. The polished interface and official partnerships make your first Japan shopping experience much smoother.

**For budget-conscious buyers:** Once you're comfortable with the process, switch to Sendico for lower fees. The savings add up quickly if you buy frequently.

**Best strategy:** Use both. Buyee for complex purchases or stores they exclusively support, Sendico for straightforward buys where you want to minimize fees.
