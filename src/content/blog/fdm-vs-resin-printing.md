faq:
  - question: "Which is better for beginners, FDM or resin?"
    answer: "FDM is better for beginners. It's safer (no toxic chemicals), easier to set up, cheaper to operate, and more forgiving of mistakes. Start with FDM, then add resin later if you need ultra-fine detail."
  - question: "Is resin printing dangerous?"
    answer: "Uncured resin is toxic and can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, and respiratory issues. Always wear nitrile gloves, work in a ventilated area, and never pour resin down the drain. Once fully cured, prints are safe to handle."
  - question: "Which is cheaper, FDM or resin?"
    answer: "FDM is cheaper overall. FDM filament costs $20-30/kg and goes further. Resin costs $30-50/L and you also need isopropyl alcohol, gloves, and a UV curing station. FDM printers are also generally cheaper than comparable resin printers."
  - question: "Can resin prints be as strong as FDM?"
    answer: "Standard resin is more brittle than FDM plastics like PETG or ABS. However, specialty resins (tough resin, ABS-like resin) can match or exceed FDM strength. For functional parts under stress, FDM is usually the better choice."
  - question: "Why do resin prints need washing and curing?"
    answer: "After printing, resin parts are covered in uncured liquid resin and aren't fully hardened. Washing removes the sticky residue, and UV curing completes the chemical reaction that makes the print solid and safe to handle."
  - question: "Can I use both FDM and resin?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Many makers have both. Use FDM for large functional parts, prototypes, and everyday prints. Use resin for miniatures, jewelry, and anything requiring fine detail. They complement each other well."
tldr: "FDM: Cheaper, safer, better for functional parts and large prints. Resin: Higher detail, smoother surfaces, better for miniatures and jewelry. Most beginners should start with FDM. Add resin later if you need ultra-fine detail."

## What is FDM Printing?

**FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)** melts plastic filament and deposits it layer by layer through a heated nozzle. Think of it like a very precise hot glue gun.

### How It Works

1. Plastic filament feeds into a heated nozzle (200-260°C)
2. Nozzle moves in X/Y while extruding melted plastic
3. Build plate moves down (or nozzle up) for each layer
4. Layers fuse together as they cool

### Common FDM Materials

- **PLA** — Easy to print, biodegradable base, low strength
- **PETG** — Stronger, more flexible, good all-rounder
- **ABS** — Heat resistant, strong, requires enclosure
- **TPU** — Flexible, rubber-like

### FDM Pros

✅ **Large build volumes** — Print big things
✅ **Cheap materials** — $20-30/kg filament
✅ **Safe to use** — No toxic chemicals
✅ **Easy to learn** — Forgiving of mistakes
✅ **Strong functional parts** — PETG/ABS are genuinely strong
✅ **Wide material variety** — Wood-fill, metal-fill, carbon fiber
✅ **Minimal post-processing** — Remove supports, done

### FDM Cons

❌ **Visible layer lines** — Surface texture is obvious
❌ **Limited detail** — Small features blur together
❌ **Supports leave marks** — Cleanup can be tedious
❌ **Slower for detailed prints** — Fine layers = long print times
❌ **Warping issues** — Especially with ABS

## What is Resin Printing?

**Resin printing (SLA/MSLA/DLP)** uses UV light to cure liquid photopolymer resin layer by layer. The print emerges from a vat of liquid resin.

### How It Works

1. Build plate dips into liquid resin vat
2. UV light (laser, LCD screen, or projector) cures one layer
3. Build plate lifts, peels cured layer from film
4. Process repeats, building upside-down

### Types of Resin Printing

- **SLA (Stereolithography)** — UV laser traces each layer
- **MSLA (Masked SLA)** — LCD screen masks UV light
- **DLP (Digital Light Processing)** — Projector flashes entire layer

Most consumer printers are MSLA—they're cheaper and faster than laser SLA.

### Common Resin Types

- **Standard resin** — Good detail, brittle
- **ABS-like resin** — More durable, less brittle
- **Tough/Flexible resin** — Impact resistant
- **Water-washable resin** — Easier cleanup (no IPA needed)
- **Plant-based resin** — Lower odor, eco-friendlier

### Resin Pros

✅ **Incredible detail** — Capture tiny features
✅ **Smooth surfaces** — Almost no visible layers
✅ **Fast for small parts** — Entire layer cures at once
✅ **Perfect for miniatures** — Industry standard for tabletop gaming
✅ **Excellent for jewelry** — Castable resins available

### Resin Cons

❌ **Toxic materials** — Requires safety precautions
❌ **Small build volume** — Most are under 150mm in each dimension
❌ **Post-processing required** — Wash, cure, every single print
❌ **Messy workflow** — Liquid resin gets everywhere
❌ **Brittle prints** — Standard resin cracks under stress
❌ **Consumables add up** — IPA, gloves, FEP films, filters
❌ **Smell** — Even "low odor" resins have a chemical smell
❌ **Disposal issues** — Can't pour resin down drains

## Print Quality Comparison

### FDM Quality

At 0.2mm layer height (standard):
- Layer lines visible on all surfaces
- Small details (under 1mm) are lost
- Supports leave marks that need cleanup
- Top surfaces can have minor artifacts

At 0.1mm layer height (fine):
- Layer lines less visible but still there
- Better small detail retention
- Print time roughly doubles

**Best finish:** Vertical surfaces look best; top surfaces depend on settings

### Resin Quality

At 0.05mm layer height (standard for resin):
- Layers essentially invisible to naked eye
- Captures details under 0.5mm
- Supports leave minimal marks
- Surfaces are smooth by default

**Best finish:** All surfaces look great; almost injection-molded appearance

### Visual Comparison

| Detail Level | FDM | Resin |
|--------------|-----|-------|
| Miniature faces | Blobby | Sharp |
| Text under 5mm | Barely readable | Crisp |
| Surface texture | Ribbed | Smooth |
| Thin walls (1mm) | Possible | Easy |
| Overhangs | Need supports, leave marks | Need supports, minimal marks |

## Safety Comparison

### FDM Safety

**Risks:** Minimal
- Hot surfaces (nozzle reaches 260°C)
- ABS releases fumes (print in ventilated area)
- Moving parts (keep hands clear)

**Precautions:**
- Don't touch hot end during printing
- Ventilate when printing ABS
- Basic common sense

### Resin Safety

**Risks:** Moderate to serious
- **Skin contact** — Causes irritation, sensitization, allergic reactions
- **Eye contact** — Severe irritation
- **Inhalation** — Respiratory irritation, headaches
- **Environmental** — Toxic to aquatic life

**Required precautions:**
- **Always wear nitrile gloves** (latex doesn't protect against resin)
- **Safety glasses** when pouring/handling resin
- **Ventilated area** or fume extraction
- **Never pour liquid resin down drains** — Cure with UV first
- **Clean spills immediately** with IPA
- **Dedicated workspace** away from food/living areas

**The reality:** Many people print resin in spare rooms or garages without issues, but you MUST follow safety protocols. Resin allergies can develop over time with repeated exposure.

## Workflow Comparison

### FDM Workflow

1. Slice model in Cura/PrusaSlicer
2. Transfer file to printer (USB/WiFi/SD)
3. Print (30 min to 20+ hours)
4. Remove from bed
5. Remove supports (if any)
6. Done

**Total hands-on time:** 5-15 minutes

### Resin Workflow

1. Slice model in Chitubox/Lychee
2. Transfer file to printer
3. Print (1-8 hours typically)
4. Remove from build plate (careful—dripping resin)
5. Wash in IPA (3-6 minutes in wash station)
6. Dry
7. Remove supports
8. UV cure (5-15 minutes in cure station)
9. Final cleanup
10. Dispose of used IPA properly (cure and evaporate)

**Total hands-on time:** 20-40 minutes

### The Hidden Time Cost

Resin printing doesn't just take more hands-on time—it takes more **mental energy**. You can't just walk away from fresh resin prints. Every print requires a multi-step post-processing routine.

FDM? Pop it off the bed, snap off supports, done.

## Best Use Cases

### Choose FDM For:

- **Functional parts** — Brackets, enclosures, tools
- **Large prints** — Cosplay helmets, vases, decorations
- **Prototyping** — Quick iterations, size checks
- **Everyday printing** — Phone stands, organizers, hooks
- **Outdoor items** — PETG/ASA handle weather
- **Beginners** — Easier, safer, more forgiving

### Choose Resin For:

- **Miniatures** — D&D figures, Warhammer, dioramas
- **Jewelry** — Rings, pendants (castable resin)
- **Dental/Medical** — Dental models, surgical guides
- **Tiny detailed parts** — Watch components, model kit details
- **Display pieces** — Statues, busts, figurines
- **Professional prototypes** — When finish matters

---

## Can You Have Both?

Absolutely. Many serious makers run both:

- **FDM** for functional parts, large prints, quick prototypes
- **Resin** for detailed miniatures, display pieces, fine work

They complement each other perfectly. The cost of a decent resin printer ($200-300) isn't prohibitive if you already have FDM experience and know you want finer detail.

**My recommendation:** Start with FDM. Learn the basics of 3D printing without safety concerns and expensive consumables. After 3-6 months, if you find yourself wanting finer detail, add a resin printer.
