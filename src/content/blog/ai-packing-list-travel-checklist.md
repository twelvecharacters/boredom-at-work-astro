faq:
  - question: "Can AI create a good packing list?"
    answer: "Yes, AI excels at packing lists because it can factor in destination weather, planned activities, trip duration, and luggage restrictions. Just be specific in your prompt."
  - question: "What's the best prompt for an AI packing list?"
    answer: "Include your destination, dates, activities planned, luggage type (carry-on or checked), and any special needs. The more context you provide, the better the list."
  - question: "Should I use AI for packing or a packing app?"
    answer: "AI is better for creating initial custom lists. Packing apps are better for reusable templates and checking items off. Use AI to create, then transfer to an app if you prefer."
