faq:
  - question: "Why are my photos always blurry?"
    answer: "Blurry photos are usually caused by: shutter speed too slow (use 1/125s or faster for handheld), camera shake (brace yourself or use a tripod), or missed focus (ensure AF is on the right subject). Increase ISO if needed to get faster shutter speeds."
  - question: "How do I take sharp photos in low light?"
    answer: "In low light: increase ISO (modern cameras handle ISO 3200+ well), use a wider aperture (f/2.8 or wider), stabilize your camera (tripod or brace against something), or add light (flash, LED panel). Prioritize shutter speed to avoid blur."
  - question: "What is the best camera setting for beginners?"
    answer: "Start with Aperture Priority mode (A or Av). Set aperture for your desired depth of field, let the camera handle shutter speed, and adjust ISO as needed. This teaches exposure while preventing major mistakes."
  - question: "Why do my photos look flat and boring?"
    answer: "Flat photos usually result from: shooting in midday harsh light (shoot golden hour instead), centering every subject (use rule of thirds), shooting from eye level only (try different angles), or not getting close enough to your subject."
  - question: "Should beginners shoot in RAW or JPEG?"
    answer: "Start with RAW+JPEG. JPEG is ready to share immediately. RAW gives you flexibility to fix exposure mistakes and learn editing later. Storage is cheap - shoot both until you develop a preference."

Every photographer makes mistakes when starting out. The difference between those who improve and those who get frustrated is learning to recognize and fix these mistakes quickly. (These tips apply to any camera — from the [Canon EOS R100](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/eos-r100) to a smartphone.)

In this guide, I'll show you the 10 most common beginner photography mistakes I see constantly - and exactly how to fix each one. These aren't theoretical problems; they're real issues that affect nearly every new photographer.

## Mistake 1: Blurry Photos from Slow Shutter Speed

The most frustrating beginner mistake: photos that look great on your camera's LCD but blurry when you view them on a computer.

### Why It Happens

Camera shake during exposure. When your shutter speed is too slow, any movement - breathing, heartbeat, pressing the shutter - creates blur.

### The Rule of Thumb

Your shutter speed should be at least 1/focal length for sharp handheld shots.

- **18mm lens:** 1/20s minimum
- **50mm lens:** 1/60s minimum
- **200mm lens:** 1/200s minimum

For beginners without steady hands, double these numbers to be safe.

### The Fix

1. **Check shutter speed before shooting** - glance at the display
2. **Increase ISO** to allow faster shutter speeds
3. **Use image stabilization** if your camera/lens has it
4. **Brace yourself** - elbows tucked, lean against something
5. **Use burst mode** - one frame might be sharper than others

### Pro Tip

For moving subjects (kids, pets, sports), use at least 1/250s regardless of focal length. Movement blur compounds camera shake.

## Mistake 2: Everything in Focus (Or Nothing)

New photographers often shoot everything at f/8 or let the camera decide aperture. The result: photos where nothing stands out.

### Understanding Aperture

- **Wide aperture (f/1.8-f/4):** Shallow depth of field, blurry background
- **Medium aperture (f/5.6-f/8):** Moderate depth of field
- **Narrow aperture (f/11-f/16):** Everything sharp

### When to Use Each

**Portraits:** f/1.8-f/4 separates your subject from the background
**Landscapes:** f/8-f/11 keeps foreground and background sharp
**Street photography:** f/5.6-f/8 provides flexibility
**Groups:** f/5.6-f/8 ensures everyone is in focus

### The Fix

1. **Use Aperture Priority mode** (A or Av) to control depth of field
2. **Learn the effect** - shoot the same scene at f/2.8, f/5.6, and f/11
3. **Consider your subject** - what should be sharp? What shouldn't?

### Common Mistake

Shooting portraits at f/1.4 sounds good, but depth of field is so thin that one eye might be sharp while the other is soft. Start at f/2.8 for portraits.

## Mistake 3: Centering Every Subject

New photographers instinctively place their subject dead center. This works sometimes, but creates static, boring compositions most of the time.

### The Rule of Thirds

Imagine your frame divided into a 3x3 grid. Place your subject on the intersection points, not the center.

**For portraits:** Eyes on the upper third line
**For landscapes:** Horizon on lower or upper third line
**For action:** Subject moving into the frame, not out of it

### The Fix

1. **Enable grid overlay** in your camera settings
2. **Consciously place subjects off-center** until it becomes habit
3. **Leave "breathing room"** in the direction your subject faces

### When Centering Works

- Symmetrical subjects (architecture, reflections)
- Powerful, confrontational portraits
- Square formats (Instagram)

Learn the rule, then break it intentionally.

## Mistake 4: Shooting Only at Eye Level

Standing straight, camera at eye level, clicking. It's the most natural way to shoot - and often the least interesting.

### Why It's a Problem

- Everyone sees the world from eye level
- It's the least dynamic angle
- It creates boring, repetitive compositions

### The Fix

**Get low:** Shoot children and pets at their eye level. Shoot upward at buildings. Lie on the ground for dramatic effect.

**Get high:** Find elevated positions. Shoot down on subjects. Use stairs, balconies, or simply raise your arms.

**Shoot through things:** Frames within frames - doorways, windows, foliage - add depth and context.

### Practical Examples

- **Children:** Kneel or sit to meet their eyes
- **Food:** Shoot directly overhead or at 45 degrees
- **Architecture:** Low angle looking up
- **Landscapes:** Low to include foreground interest

## Mistake 5: Bad Light (Or Ignoring Light Entirely)

Light is photography. Yet beginners often pay more attention to their subject than the light falling on it.

### The Worst Light

**Midday sun:** Harsh shadows, squinting subjects, high contrast. The worst time for most photography.

### The Best Light

**Golden hour:** First/last hour of sunlight. Warm, soft, directional. Transforms ordinary scenes.

**Overcast:** Soft, even light. Perfect for portraits - no harsh shadows.

**Shade:** Open shade on sunny days provides soft, flattering light.

### The Fix

1. **Shoot during golden hour** for outdoor portraits and landscapes
2. **Move subjects to shade** in harsh light
3. **Position light source** to the side for dimension
4. **Turn off flash** indoors near windows - natural light is more flattering

### Understanding Light Direction

- **Front light:** Flat, safe, boring
- **Side light:** Dramatic, dimensional, interesting
- **Backlight:** Challenging but beautiful (watch for lens flare)

## Mistake 6: Not Getting Close Enough

Robert Capa said: "If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough." This applies to almost every beginner photographer.

### Why Distance Kills Photos

- Subjects get lost in busy backgrounds
- Details disappear
- Emotional connection weakens
- Composition becomes cluttered

### The Fix

1. **Fill the frame** with your subject
2. **Zoom with your feet** - physically move closer
3. **Eliminate distractions** - if it doesn't add, it subtracts
4. **Shoot, then step closer** and shoot again

### When to Step Back

- Environmental portraits where context matters
- Landscapes where scale is the subject
- Architecture where geometry needs space

But even then, most beginners include too much, not too little.

## Mistake 7: Relying Only on Auto Mode

Full Auto mode prevents disasters but also prevents growth. You can't learn photography if the camera makes every decision.

### The Learning Path

**Week 1-2:** Full Auto to focus on composition
**Week 3-4:** Program mode (P) with exposure compensation
**Month 2:** Aperture Priority (A/Av) for depth of field control
**Month 3:** Shutter Priority (S/Tv) for motion control
**Month 4+:** Manual when needed

### The Fix

1. **Use Aperture Priority (A/Av)** for most situations
2. **Learn to read the exposure meter**
3. **Use exposure compensation** (+/- button) to adjust
4. **Check histograms** to evaluate exposure

### When Auto Is Fine

- Fast-moving situations where you can't adjust
- When handing camera to someone else
- Family snapshots where missing the moment is worse than imperfect exposure

## Mistake 8: Ignoring the Background

Beginners focus entirely on their subject, missing the tree growing out of someone's head, the distracting sign, or the cluttered background.

### Common Background Problems

- Objects "growing" from subjects' heads
- Bright distractions pulling attention
- Busy patterns competing with subject
- Horizon lines cutting through heads

### The Fix

1. **Scan the entire frame** before shooting
2. **Move your position** slightly - often fixes background issues
3. **Use wider aperture** to blur distracting backgrounds
4. **Simplify** - clean backgrounds create powerful images

### Pro Tip

Before pressing the shutter, consciously look at all four corners of your frame. What's there? Does it help or hurt?

## Mistake 9: Not Understanding ISO

ISO is the most misunderstood setting. Beginners either leave it at 100 (blurry photos in low light) or ignore it (camera in Auto-ISO making questionable choices).

### What ISO Actually Does

Higher ISO = brighter image = more noise (grain)
Lower ISO = darker image = cleaner files

### When to Increase ISO

**Indoors without flash:** ISO 800-3200
**Evening/night:** ISO 1600-6400
**Action in low light:** ISO 3200+
**Cloudy days:** ISO 400-800

### The Fix

1. **Modern cameras handle high ISO well** - don't fear ISO 3200+
2. **A noisy photo is better than a blurry photo** - increase ISO for faster shutter
3. **Learn Auto-ISO limits** - set maximum ISO you're comfortable with
4. **Test your camera** - shoot the same scene at different ISOs to learn its limits

### The Modern Reality

Entry-level cameras in 2026 produce clean images at ISO 3200 and usable images at ISO 6400. Don't sacrifice shutter speed to stay at ISO 100.

## Mistake 10: Never Deleting Bad Photos

Keeping every photo creates several problems:
- Storage fills up quickly
- Finding good photos becomes hard
- You don't develop critical judgment
- Mediocre work dilutes your portfolio

### Why We Keep Bad Photos

- "Maybe I can fix it in editing" (you won't)
- "But I was there" (memory isn't quality)
- Fear of deleting something good
- Not knowing what makes a photo bad

### The Fix

**In-camera:** Delete obvious failures immediately - completely out of focus, accidental shots, test shots.

**First cull:** Import to computer, quick pass deleting obviously bad images.

**Second cull:** Rate remaining images 1-5 stars. Only keep 3+ stars.

**Final edit:** Select only the best version of similar shots. A fast RAW editor like [RapidRAW](/rapid-raw-image-editor-guide/) makes this process much quicker.

### Be Ruthless

Better to have 10 excellent photos than 500 mediocre ones. Professional photographers might keep 1-5% of what they shoot.

## Bonus: Quick Fix Checklist

Before every shot, quickly check:

1. **Light** - Is the direction flattering?
2. **Background** - Is it clean and undistracting?
3. **Composition** - Is the subject off-center? Filling the frame?
4. **Settings** - Is shutter speed fast enough?
5. **Focus** - Is it on the right subject (the eyes)?

## The Most Important Lesson

Every photographer makes these mistakes. The masters simply made them earlier and more often.

Don't get discouraged by bad photos. Each one teaches you something. Review your failures, identify what went wrong, and deliberately practice the fix.

In six months of intentional practice, you'll look back at today's photos and cringe - and that's exactly how it should be. Growth requires discomfort.

Now go shoot, make mistakes, and learn from them.
