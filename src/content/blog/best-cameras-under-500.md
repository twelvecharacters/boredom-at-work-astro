**Buy Used If:**
- You want more camera for your money
- You're comfortable with reputable dealers
- Features like tilting screens matter
- You're eyeing Nikon Z50 or Sony A6100

### Key Features to Prioritize

**For Portraits:** Prioritize autofocus with eye detection (Canon R100, used Z50)

**For Action/Sports:** Prioritize continuous shooting speed (Sony A6000)

**For Video:** Prioritize 4K and screen articulation (Fujifilm X-T200)

**For Learning:** Prioritize ease of use and guided modes (Canon R100, Rebel T7)

### Lens Considerations

Your camera body is just the beginning. Consider lens availability:

- **Sony E (A6000/A6100):** Largest selection, many third-party options
- **Canon EF (T7):** Massive used lens market
- **Fujifilm X (X-T200):** Quality over quantity, all lenses are good

Don't forget these essentials when planning your purchase:

### Must-Have ($50-80)
- Memory card: 64GB UHS-I ($15-20)
- Spare battery ($30-50)
- Camera bag ($20-40)

### Recommended ($50-100)
- UV filter for lens protection ($15-25)
- Cleaning kit ($15-20)
- Basic tripod ($30-60)

## My Recommendation

For most photographers on a budget in 2026, the **Canon EOS R100** is the best camera under $500. It offers modern mirrorless technology, excellent autofocus, and a path to grow within Canon's ecosystem.

If you're comfortable buying used, the **Nikon Z50** offers significantly more camera for similar money. Its superior build quality, tilting screen, and better video specs make it worth considering.

For action and speed, the **Sony A6000** remains relevant despite its age. Its fast autofocus and 11fps burst rate are unmatched at this price.

Whatever you choose, remember that any camera in this guide can produce professional-quality images. The best camera is the one you'll actually use - so pick one that feels right in your hands and start shooting.
