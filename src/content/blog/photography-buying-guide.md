tldr: "Get a Canon EOS R100 (~$480) or Nikon Z50 II (~$860) to start. Used original Z50 for under $500 is also great. Skip the expensive lenses until you know what you actually need."
faq:
  - question: "What's the best camera for beginners?"
    answer: "The Canon EOS R100 (~$480) offers the best balance of price, features, and room to grow. If you can stretch to ~$860, the Nikon Z50 II is an excellent step up with improved autofocus and 4K video. A used original Z50 (~$450-500) is also great value."
  - question: "Should I buy a DSLR or mirrorless camera?"
    answer: "Mirrorless is the future and what manufacturers are investing in. Buy mirrorless unless you find an incredible deal on a used DSLR with lenses."
  - question: "Do I even need a camera if I have a good phone?"
    answer: "Phones are excellent for casual photography. Get a dedicated camera if you want more control, better low-light performance, or interchangeable lenses for specific needs."
  - question: "How much should I spend on my first camera?"
    answer: "Between $400-700 gets you excellent entry-level mirrorless cameras. Don't spend more until you know what you actually need. Many pros started with cheaper gear than that."
  - question: "Is buying used camera gear safe?"
    answer: "Yes, if you buy from reputable sources. Check shutter count for bodies, look for fungus in lenses, and buy from platforms with buyer protection. The used market offers 30-50% savings on excellent gear."

So you want to get into photography. The internet is full of gear heads arguing about sensor sizes and autofocus points. Here's what actually matters when you're starting out.

This hub brings together everything you need to make smart buying decisions — from whether you even need a camera to exactly what to buy at every budget level.

## Before You Buy: The Honest Questions

Photography gear can be a money pit. Before spending anything, let's make sure you're buying for the right reasons.

### Do You Even Need a Camera?

Modern smartphones have incredible cameras. The iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra can produce stunning images that would have required professional gear a decade ago. So when does a dedicated camera actually make sense?

**Get a camera if you want:**
- **Manual control** — Shutter speed, aperture, ISO at your fingertips
- **Better low-light performance** — Larger sensors capture more light
- **Shallow depth of field** — That creamy background blur (bokeh)
- **Interchangeable lenses** — Wide, telephoto, macro, specialty
- **Raw files** — Maximum editing flexibility
- **Optical zoom** — Real zoom, not digital cropping
- **To learn the craft** — Photography as a skill, not just snapshots

**Stick with your phone if you:**
- Mostly share on social media (Instagram compresses everything anyway)
- Value convenience over control
- Take photos occasionally, not as a hobby
- Aren't sure photography is "your thing" yet

**Recommended reading:** [Camera vs Smartphone](/camera-vs-smartphone/) — The complete breakdown of when each makes sense.

### The Real Cost of Photography

Cameras are just the beginning. Here's what a realistic first-year budget looks like:

| Item | Budget Option | Mid-Range |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Camera body + kit lens | $400-500 | $700-900 |
| Memory card (128GB) | $20 | $20 |
| Extra battery | $25 | $40 |
| Camera bag | $30 | $60 |
| First prime lens | $100-150 | $200-300 |
| Tripod | $30 | $80 |
| Editing software | Free (Darktable) | $10/mo (Lightroom) |
| **Year 1 Total** | **~$650** | **~$1,200** |

Don't buy everything at once. Start with the camera and kit lens, then add gear as you identify specific needs.

## The Big Decision: DSLR vs Mirrorless

This is the first choice you'll face. Here's the simple answer: **buy mirrorless**.

### Why Mirrorless Wins in 2026

- **It's the future.** [Canon](https://canon.com), [Nikon](https://nikon.com), and [Sony](https://sony.com) have all shifted R&D to mirrorless. New lenses and features come to mirrorless first.
- **Better autofocus.** Eye-tracking AF that follows subjects across the frame is standard on mirrorless, rare on DSLRs.
- **Smaller and lighter.** No mirror box means more compact bodies.
- **What you see is what you get.** The electronic viewfinder shows your actual exposure in real-time.
- **Silent shooting.** Electronic shutters make no sound — great for events and wildlife.

### When DSLR Still Makes Sense

- You find an incredible used deal (body + lenses under $300)
- You want optical viewfinder experience
- Battery life is critical (DSLRs last longer per charge)
- You're buying into a system where someone's giving you their old lenses

## Choosing Your First Camera

Now let's get specific. Here are the best options at every budget level in 2026.

### Budget Tier: Under $500

At this level, you're looking at entry-level mirrorless or used gear.

| Camera | Price | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------|------|------|

| **Used Sony A6000** | ~$300-350 | Excellent AF, compact | Older (2014), no 4K |
| **Used Nikon Z50** | ~$450-500 | Great image quality, tilting screen (successor: Z50 II ~$860) | Smaller lens selection |
| **Used Fujifilm X-T200** | ~$400 | Beautiful colors, fun dials | Discontinued |

**Our pick:** Canon EOS R100 for new gear, Used Sony A6000 for maximum value.

### Mid-Range: $500-800

This is the sweet spot for most beginners. You get modern features without overspending.

| **Canon EOS R50** | ~$680 | Compact, great video, excellent AF | Smaller battery |
| **Fujifilm X-S10** | ~$800 (used) | In-body stabilization, beautiful colors | Discontinued |

## Understanding Lenses (More Important Than Bodies)

Here's a secret: lenses matter more than camera bodies. A great lens on a cheap body beats a cheap lens on an expensive body.

### Kit Lenses: Good Enough to Start

Every camera comes with a "kit lens" — usually an 18-55mm or 15-45mm zoom. These are designed to be versatile and affordable.

**Kit lens pros:**
- Covers wide to short telephoto (good for most situations)
- Lightweight and compact
- Included in the price

**Kit lens cons:**
- Slow aperture (f/3.5-5.6) — not great in low light
- Average sharpness
- Plastic build quality

**Verdict:** Use the kit lens for 6 months. It's good enough to learn. Only upgrade when you know exactly what you need.

### Your First Upgrade: The "Nifty Fifty"

A 50mm f/1.8 prime lens (called the "nifty fifty") should be your first additional purchase:

- **Low light performance:** f/1.8 lets in way more light than kit lenses
- **Background blur:** Beautiful bokeh for portraits
- **Sharp:** Prime lenses are sharper than zooms at the same price
- **Affordable:** $100-200 depending on brand

Every major brand makes one:
- Canon RF 50mm f/1.8 STM — ~$200
- Nikon Z 40mm f/2 — ~$280
- Sony FE 50mm f/1.8 — ~$200

### Lens Buying Priority

After the kit lens and nifty fifty, here's what to consider based on your style:

| Photography Style | Next Lens | Why |
|-------------------|-----------|-----|
| Portraits | 85mm f/1.8 | Flattering focal length, great blur |
| Landscapes | 16-35mm wide angle | Capture sweeping scenes |
| Street | 35mm f/2.8 | Classic focal length, compact |
| Wildlife/Sports | 70-300mm telephoto | Reach distant subjects |
| Macro | 90mm macro | True 1:1 magnification |

## Avoid These Beginner Mistakes

Learning from others' mistakes saves money and frustration.

### Mistake 1: Buying Too Much Gear

You don't need a camera bag full of lenses. Most pros use 2-3 lenses for 90% of their work. Start with the kit lens, identify what's limiting you, then buy specifically to solve that problem.

### Mistake 2: Obsessing Over Specs

Megapixels, dynamic range, ISO performance — these matter far less than composition and lighting. A 12-megapixel camera from 2015 can take better photos than a 45-megapixel camera in untrained hands.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Used Market

Camera gear holds value well and used gear is often barely used. A camera with 5,000 shutter clicks is essentially new. The used market offers 30-50% savings.

**Where to buy used:**
- MPB (warranty included)
- KEH Camera
- Facebook Marketplace (meet in person)
- r/photomarket
- eBay (check seller ratings)

### Mistake 4: Buying Cheap Tripods

A wobbly tripod is worse than no tripod. Spend $80-100 on a decent aluminum tripod rather than $30 on one that shakes in the wind.

### Mistake 5: Skipping the Manual

Modern cameras have incredible features buried in menus. Spend an evening reading the manual. You'll discover functions that would take months to find randomly.

## Buying from Japan

Some of the best camera deals are on the Japanese used market. Japanese sellers are known for honest condition grading and excellent packaging.

### Why Japan?

- Prices are often 20-40% lower than US/EU
- Japanese sellers grade condition conservatively (their "Good" is often "Excellent" elsewhere)
- Vintage lenses are abundant
- Unique limited editions and Japanese-market cameras

### How to Buy

You'll need a proxy service that buys on your behalf and ships internationally:

- **[Buyee](https://buyee.jp)** — Easiest to use, higher fees
- **[Sendico](https://sendico.com)** — Lower fees, more manual
- **From Japan** — Good for high-value items

## The Recommended Path

### Month 1: Start Shooting
1. Buy an entry-level mirrorless (Canon R100 or used Sony A6000)
2. Use only the kit lens
3. Shoot 500+ photos
4. Learn the exposure triangle (aperture, shutter speed, ISO)

### Months 2-3: Learn the Fundamentals
1. Study composition (rule of thirds, leading lines, framing)
2. Practice in different lighting conditions
3. Learn basic editing (Lightroom or free alternatives)
4. Shoot 1000+ more photos

### Months 4-6: Identify Your Style
After 3-6 months, you'll know if you prefer:
- **Portraits** → Need fast prime lenses (50mm, 85mm)
- **Landscapes** → Need wide angle lens, tripod
- **Street** → Need compact setup (35mm prime)
- **Wildlife** → Need telephoto zoom, fast AF body
- **Macro** → Need dedicated macro lens

### Month 6+: Upgrade Strategically
Now you're ready to spend money wisely:
1. Buy the specific lens for your style
2. Consider a body upgrade only if your current one is limiting you
3. Add accessories based on real needs, not "might use someday"

## The Bottom Line

Photography gear can be a rabbit hole. Here's how to avoid it:

1. **Buy one camera body** — Entry-level mirrorless is perfect
2. **Use the kit lens for 6 months** — It's better than you think
3. **Take 1000 photos before buying anything else** — Learn what you actually need
4. **Upgrade to solve specific problems** — Not because gear looks cool

The best camera is the one you actually use. Start simple, learn the craft, then spend money where it matters.

Your first 10,000 photos are your worst — and you need to take them to get to the good ones. No amount of gear skips that step.
