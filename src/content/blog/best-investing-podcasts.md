faq:
  - question: "What is the best investing podcast for beginners?"
    answer: "Planet Money from NPR is the best starting point. Episodes are 20-30 minutes, cover one economic concept per episode in plain language, and use real-world stories to make finance interesting. It's not strictly an investing podcast, but it builds the economic literacy that makes investing concepts click. For more investing-specific content, The Motley Fool's Motley Fool Money podcast breaks down weekly market news in a beginner-friendly way."
  - question: "Can I learn investing just from podcasts?"
    answer: "Podcasts are excellent for building investing knowledge, but they work best combined with other resources. They're great for: understanding concepts, hearing expert perspectives, staying current on markets, and building an investing mindset. They're not great for: learning specific mechanics (how to place a trade, read a financial statement, or set up an account). Pair podcasts with a free investing course like Khan Academy and a paper trading app for the most complete learning experience."
  - question: "How many investing podcasts should I listen to?"
    answer: "Start with one or two that match your current level. More than three and you'll spend more time consuming content than actually investing. Pick one education-focused podcast (like Planet Money or The Plain Bagel) and one market-focused podcast (like Motley Fool Money or We Study Billionaires). As you advance, swap in more sophisticated shows. Quality of attention matters more than quantity of podcasts."

> **Disclaimer:** This article reviews investing podcasts for educational purposes. Nothing here is financial advice. Always do your own research and consider consulting a qualified professional before making investment decisions.

Here's the beauty of investing podcasts: nobody can tell you're listening to one. Earbuds in, [noise-canceling headphones](/best-noise-canceling-headphones-office/) on, and as far as your coworkers know, you're on a very important conference call.

In reality, you're learning about compound interest, index fund allocation, and why Warren Buffett hasn't sold his Coca-Cola shares since 1988. You're getting a finance education during hours that would otherwise be spent staring at Slack messages or pretending to review a document you already reviewed.

I've been listening to investing podcasts during work hours for over a year. Some are genuinely educational. Some are an hour of hosts talking in circles. And some start beginner-friendly but quickly assume you know what a "covered call spread" is.

These 8 are the ones worth your time, organized from "I don't know what an ETF is" to "I'm building a DCF model for fun."

## Beginner

### 1. Planet Money (NPR) — Best for Economic Literacy

**Hosts:** Various NPR journalists | **Length:** 20-30 minutes | **Frequency:** 2-3 episodes/week | **Since:** 2008

Planet Money doesn't call itself an investing podcast, and that's what makes it perfect for beginners. Instead of market tips or stock picks, it tells stories about how money, economics, and markets actually work.

**What you'll hear:**
- Why oil prices affect your grocery bill
- How the Federal Reserve actually makes decisions
- The economics behind everyday things (tipping, airline pricing, housing markets)
- Investigative stories about financial fraud and market quirks

**Why it's great for beginners:** Each episode is a self-contained story — no prior knowledge assumed, no jargon without explanation. You can start with any episode. The storytelling makes complex economics genuinely entertaining, which matters because you won't learn from a podcast you stop listening to.

**Best episodes to start with:**
- "The Invention of Money" — How money works (and why we trust paper)
- "The Giant Pool of Money" — The 2008 financial crisis explained simply
- Any recent episode — they're all accessible

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★★★ — Short episodes, easy to pause and resume, no complex charts to follow.

---

### 2. The Plain Bagel — Best Explanations

**Host:** Richard Coffin, CFA | **Length:** 20-30 minutes | **Frequency:** Bi-weekly | **Since:** 2018

Richard Coffin is a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) who explains investing concepts the way a patient friend would. No hype, no clickbait, just clear and thorough breakdowns.

**What you'll hear:**
- Investing concept explainers (P/E ratios, bonds, ETFs, diversification)
- Market event analysis (what happened and what it means)
- Myth-busting (common investing misconceptions debunked with data)
- Historical case studies of market events

**Why it's great for beginners:** Coffin has a genuine talent for making complex topics simple without dumbing them down. He uses data and evidence rather than opinions. The episodes are short enough to fit in a lunch break and focused enough that you actually retain what you learned.

**Also a YouTube channel:** If you prefer visual explanations, The Plain Bagel's YouTube videos include charts and graphics that complement the audio content.

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★★★ — The shortest episodes on this list. Perfect for a single work break.

---

### 3. Motley Fool Money — Best Weekly Market Overview

**Hosts:** Dylan Lewis, various Motley Fool analysts | **Length:** 20-40 minutes | **Frequency:** Daily (weekdays) | **Since:** 2011

Motley Fool Money is the podcast equivalent of a friendly market recap. Each episode covers the week's biggest business and market news, with analysis from Motley Fool's team of analysts.

**What you'll hear:**
- Weekly market news and earnings highlights
- Individual company analysis and stock discussions
- Interview episodes with CEOs, authors, and industry experts
- Year-end reviews and predictions

**Why it's great for beginners:** The hosts explain market events in conversational language. When they discuss a stock, they explain the business model, not just the price movement. Over time, you build a natural understanding of how markets work simply by listening to the weekly discussions.

**A note about Motley Fool's business model:** Motley Fool runs paid stock-picking services (Stock Advisor, Rule Breakers). The podcast is free and doesn't hard-sell the paid products, but you should know the parent company's model. The podcast analysis is sound regardless.

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★★ — Daily episodes keep you current. The conversational tone makes it easy to listen while doing light work.

## Intermediate

### 4. ChooseFI — Best for Financial Independence

**Hosts:** Jonathan Mendonsa & Brad Barrett | **Length:** 45-60 minutes | **Frequency:** Weekly (+ bonus episodes) | **Since:** 2017

ChooseFI is the podcast arm of the financial independence / retire early (FIRE) movement. It covers everything from index investing to tax optimization to "life hacking" your way to financial freedom.

**What you'll hear:**
- FIRE strategies and real-world case studies
- Tax optimization (Roth conversion ladders, HSA strategies, tax-gain harvesting)
- Real estate investing (house hacking, rental properties)
- Career optimization and side income
- Community member stories (people on the FIRE path sharing progress)

**Why it's great:** ChooseFI makes FIRE feel achievable rather than extreme. The hosts are relatable, the strategies are practical, and the community episodes prove that regular people (not just tech millionaires) are reaching financial independence. It's motivating without being preachy.

**Pairs well with:** The r/financialindependence and r/Bogleheads communities on Reddit (see our [finance subreddits guide](/best-finance-subreddits/)).

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★★ — Longer episodes, but content-dense. Good for commutes or extended focus blocks.

---

### 5. We Study Billionaires — Best for Value Investing

**Hosts:** Stig Brodersen & Clay Finck (The Investor's Podcast Network) | **Length:** 45-75 minutes | **Frequency:** Weekly | **Since:** 2014

We Study Billionaires does what the name says — studies the investment strategies of the world's most successful investors. Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Ray Dalio, Howard Marks, and many others.

**What you'll hear:**
- Deep dives into legendary investors' strategies and philosophies
- Book reviews of investing classics (The Intelligent Investor, The Most Important Thing)
- Individual stock analysis using value investing frameworks
- Macro-economic analysis and market outlook
- Interviews with fund managers, authors, and economists

**Why it's great:** This podcast bridges the gap between "I understand the basics" and "I can actually analyze an investment." The book review episodes are particularly valuable — you get the key insights from 300-page investing books distilled into an hour. The stock analysis episodes model how to think about businesses, not just stock prices.

**Why it's intermediate, not beginner:** The hosts assume some baseline knowledge. Terms like DCF, intrinsic value, margin of safety, and earnings yield come up without detailed explanation. If these terms are unfamiliar, start with The Plain Bagel for a few months first.

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★ — Longer, denser episodes that reward focused listening. Better for commutes than background audio.

### 6. The Rational Reminder — Best Evidence-Based Investing

**Hosts:** Ben Felix & Cameron Passmore (PWL Capital) | **Length:** 60-90 minutes | **Frequency:** Weekly | **Since:** 2019

The Rational Reminder is the closest thing to an academic investing seminar in podcast form. Ben Felix (also a popular YouTube creator) and Cameron Passmore (portfolio manager) discuss investing through the lens of financial research and evidence.

**What you'll hear:**
- Academic research translated into practical investing insights
- Factor investing deep dives (value, size, profitability, momentum)
- Retirement planning and withdrawal strategies with data
- Interviews with finance professors and researchers
- Myth-busting with peer-reviewed sources

**Why it's great:** In a world of opinions, The Rational Reminder insists on evidence. Every claim is backed by research. When they say "small-cap value stocks have historically outperformed," they cite the specific studies. This approach builds a knowledge base that's resilient to market hype and trends.

**Why it's intermediate-advanced:** Episodes frequently reference academic papers, regression analysis, and factor models. Ben Felix explains things well, but the content assumes you're comfortable with investing fundamentals. The episodes are also long — 60-90 minutes requires commitment.

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★ — Dense, long episodes. Best consumed in dedicated learning blocks rather than background listening.

## Advanced

### 7. Animal Spirits — Best Market Commentary

**Hosts:** Michael Batnick & Ben Carlson (Ritholtz Wealth Management) | **Length:** 30-45 minutes | **Frequency:** Weekly | **Since:** 2017

Two wealth management professionals discussing markets, economics, and investing with genuine personality and humor. Animal Spirits is the "two smart friends talking about money" podcast done right.

**What you'll hear:**
- Current market analysis and commentary
- Behavioral finance insights (why investors do dumb things)
- Chart of the week discussions (data-driven market observations)
- Personal finance hot takes and debates
- Pop culture intersecting with finance

**Why it's great:** Batnick and Carlson are knowledgeable enough for sophisticated analysis but personable enough to keep it entertaining. The behavioral finance angle is unique — understanding *why* investors panic, chase trends, or hold losers is arguably more valuable than technical analysis. They disagree with each other frequently, which keeps the discussion honest.

**Why it's intermediate-advanced:** The hosts don't explain basic concepts. References to yield curves, equity risk premiums, and correlation matrices fly by without pause. If you're nodding along, you'll love it. If you're Googling every third term, listen to We Study Billionaires first.

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★★ — Short enough for a work break, entertaining enough to look forward to.

### 8. Invest Like the Best — Best Deep-Dive Interviews

**Host:** Patrick O'Shaughnessy (Positive Sum) | **Length:** 45-75 minutes | **Frequency:** Weekly | **Since:** 2016

Invest Like the Best is the gold standard for long-form investing interviews. Patrick O'Shaughnessy talks to fund managers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and thinkers about how they approach investing and business.

**What you'll hear:**
- Extended interviews with top investors and business leaders
- Investment strategy deep dives (venture capital, public equities, real estate, crypto)
- Business model analysis and competitive strategy
- Technology trends and their investment implications
- Philosophy of investing and decision-making

**Why it's great:** The guest quality is exceptional. Previous guests include Bill Gurley, Howard Marks, Annie Duke, Marc Andreessen, and hundreds of other world-class thinkers. O'Shaughnessy asks thoughtful questions and lets guests develop ideas fully — no soundbites, no rushing.

**Why it's advanced:** Many episodes discuss institutional investing, venture capital, or quantitative strategies that aren't relevant to individual investors. The conversations assume familiarity with investing concepts and market structure. But even when the specifics don't apply to your portfolio, the thinking frameworks are universally valuable.

**Work-friendliness:** ★★★ — Long episodes that demand attention. Best for dedicated learning time or long commutes.

## Tips for Learning from Investing Podcasts

1. **Take notes** — Keep a note on your phone for new terms, book recommendations, and ideas to research later
2. **Follow up** — When a podcast mentions a concept you don't understand, search for it on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain) or Investopedia
3. **Apply what you learn** — After hearing about a strategy, test it in a [paper trading app](/best-paper-trading-apps/) before using real money
4. **Don't act on impulse** — A podcast discussing a stock isn't a buy signal. Do your own research using [stock screeners](/best-free-stock-screeners/) and financial statements
5. **Rotate based on your level** — As you advance, swap beginner shows for intermediate ones. You'll know you've leveled up when a podcast stops teaching you new things

## The Bottom Line

Investing podcasts are stealth education. You're building financial literacy during hours that would otherwise be dead time — commutes, lunch breaks, those stretches of work where you're technically present but mentally checked out.

Start with **Planet Money** (economic literacy) and **The Plain Bagel** (investing concepts). Add **Motley Fool Money** when you want to follow markets weekly. Graduate to **We Study Billionaires** and **The Rational Reminder** as your knowledge deepens.

The best investing education is the one you actually consume. And podcasts fit into your day without requiring you to sit down and study.
