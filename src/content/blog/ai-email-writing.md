faq:
  - question: "Is it okay to use AI to write emails?"
    answer: "Yes, for most professional emails. AI helps with drafting, not replacing your judgment. Always review before sending, add personal touches, and never use AI for highly sensitive communications without careful editing."
  - question: "Can people tell if an email was written by AI?"
    answer: "Generic AI output is often detectable—it sounds too perfect, uses certain phrases repeatedly, and lacks personality. The solution: use AI for the first draft, then edit to add your voice and specific details."
  - question: "What's the best AI tool for email writing?"
    answer: "For general email drafting, ChatGPT and Claude both work excellently. For Gmail users, Gemini integrates directly. For Outlook users, Copilot is built-in. For grammar and tone, Grammarly is still the gold standard."
  - question: "How do I make AI emails sound more human?"
    answer: "Add specific details AI doesn't know (names, inside references, context). Vary sentence length. Remove overly formal phrases. Add a personal touch at the end. Read it aloud—if it sounds robotic, edit it."
  - question: "Should I disclose that I used AI to write an email?"
    answer: "Not typically necessary for routine business emails, as you're still reviewing and taking responsibility. For academic or legal contexts, check specific policies. The key is that you verify and own the content."
tldr: "Use AI to draft emails faster, not to replace thinking. Give context (who, what, tone), get a draft, then edit to add your voice. Best prompts include: recipient relationship, goal of email, desired tone, and any constraints. Always read before sending—AI drafts are starting points, not final products."

You spend hours on email every week. Much of it is repetitive: scheduling, following up, saying no politely, asking for things.

AI can cut that time dramatically—without making you sound like a robot.

Here's how to use AI for email writing effectively, with templates and prompts you can copy today.

## The Right Mindset

AI doesn't write emails for you. It drafts emails that you then make yours.

**AI is good at:**
- Structure and formatting
- Professional phrasing
- Getting past blank-page paralysis
- Suggesting approaches you hadn't considered

**AI needs you for:**
- Specific details and context
- Your actual voice and personality
- Judgment about tone and appropriateness
- Final review and approval

Think of AI as a writing assistant who creates the first draft. You're still the author.

## The Basic Formula

Every AI email prompt needs four things:

1. **Who** — Recipient and your relationship
2. **What** — Purpose of the email
3. **Tone** — How it should sound
4. **Constraints** — Length, format, things to include/avoid

**Basic template:**

```
Write an email to [WHO: relationship + context].

Purpose: [WHAT: specific goal]

Tone: [professional/casual/friendly/formal/apologetic/firm]

Keep it [LENGTH: short/medium/detailed].

Include: [specific points]
Avoid: [things to leave out]
```

---

## Email Templates by Situation

### 1. Following Up (No Response)

**Prompt:**
```
Write a polite follow-up email to a potential client who hasn't 
responded to my proposal sent last week.

Tone: Professional but not pushy
Goal: Prompt a response without being annoying
Length: 3-4 sentences max
Include: Reference to the original email, offer to answer questions
```

**Why it works:** Specific context, clear goal, explicit tone guidance.

---

### 2. Declining a Request

**Prompt:**
```
Write an email declining a meeting request from a colleague who 
wants to "pick my brain" about career advice.

Tone: Warm but firm
Goal: Say no clearly while maintaining the relationship
Include: Brief reason (busy with deadline), alternative suggestion 
(coffee next month or async questions via email)
Avoid: Over-apologizing, leaving door open for pushback
```

---

### 3. Asking for Something

**Prompt:**
```
Write an email to my manager requesting approval for a $500 
conference registration.

Tone: Professional, confident
Goal: Get approval
Include: Conference name/date, specific benefits to the team, 
that I'll share learnings afterward
Length: Keep it concise—managers are busy
```

---

### 4. Difficult Conversations

**Prompt:**
```
Write an email to a vendor about consistently late deliveries. 
This is the third time in two months.

Tone: Firm but professional—not angry
Goal: Get commitment to improvement, document the issue
Include: Specific dates of late deliveries, impact on our work, 
request for explanation and remediation plan
Avoid: Threats, emotional language, anything that could damage 
the long-term relationship
```

---

### 5. Cold Outreach

**Prompt:**
```
Write a cold email to a marketing director at a mid-size SaaS company.
I'm offering consulting services for content strategy.

Tone: Confident, not salesy
Goal: Get a 15-minute call
Include: One specific observation about their current content, 
brief credibility (worked with similar companies), clear CTA
Length: Under 150 words—busy people won't read more
Avoid: Generic flattery, multiple CTAs, attachments
```

---

### 6. Thank You / Appreciation

**Prompt:**
```
Write a thank-you email to a colleague who helped me prepare 
for a big presentation last week. The presentation went well 
and I got positive feedback from leadership.

Tone: Genuine, warm
Goal: Express real appreciation, strengthen relationship
Include: Specific things they helped with, outcome of the presentation
Avoid: Sounding generic or obligatory
```

---

### 7. Introducing Yourself

**Prompt:**
```
Write an email introducing myself to a new team I'm joining 
as a product manager.

Tone: Friendly, approachable, professional
Include: My background briefly, excitement about joining, 
invitation to chat
Length: Short—people will learn more about me over time
Avoid: Listing all my accomplishments, being too formal
```

---

### 8. Scheduling

**Prompt:**
```
Write an email to schedule a project kickoff meeting with 
5 stakeholders from different departments.

Tone: Efficient, professional
Include: Purpose of meeting, proposed times (give 3 options), 
expected duration (1 hour), ask for agenda items
Length: Brief and scannable
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Match Someone's Style

If you need to match a specific tone, show AI an example:

```
Write an email declining a speaking invitation. Match the 
tone of this email I wrote previously:

[Paste your previous email]

New context: Declining an invitation to speak at a local 
business meetup because of scheduling conflict.
```

### Handle Tricky Situations

For sensitive emails, ask AI to think through approaches:

```
I need to email my manager about burnout without seeming 
like I can't handle my job. What are 3 different approaches 
I could take? For each, give me a brief email draft.
```

Then pick elements from different versions.

### Generate Options

When tone is tricky, get multiple versions:

```
Write 3 versions of a follow-up email after a job interview:
1. Confident and brief
2. Enthusiastic and detailed  
3. Professional and reserved

Context: Second-round interview for senior analyst role, 
went well, interviewer mentioned timeline of 2 weeks.
```

## Making AI Emails Sound Human

AI drafts often have tells:

- Too perfect grammar
- Generic phrases ("I hope this email finds you well")
- Consistent sentence structure
- Missing personality

### Fixes:

**Add specifics AI doesn't know:**
```
Before: "Thank you for your help with the project."
After: "Thank you for staying late Tuesday to fix the dashboard bug—you saved the client demo."
```

**Vary your sentence length:**
```
Before: "I wanted to follow up on our discussion. I think the proposal has merit. Let me know your thoughts."
After: "Following up on our discussion. I think this proposal has real merit—especially the timeline. Thoughts?"
```

**Remove AI-isms:**
- "I hope this email finds you well" → Just start with your point
- "Please do not hesitate to reach out" → "Let me know if you have questions"
- "I wanted to touch base" → Be specific about why

**Add your voice:**
End with something only you would say. An inside joke, a reference to a shared experience, or just your natural sign-off.

## When NOT to Use AI

Some emails need to be fully human:

- **Condolences or serious personal matters** — AI can't feel, and it shows
- **Highly sensitive HR issues** — Too much at stake for AI errors
- **Legal or contractual matters** — Review with actual humans
- **Relationship-critical communications** — When authenticity matters most
- **When you're told not to** — Some companies have AI policies

For these, AI can help you *think through* what to say, but write it yourself.

## Quick-Reference Prompts

Copy these and fill in the brackets:

**Professional request:**
```
Write a professional email requesting [THING] from [PERSON/ROLE]. 
Keep it under 100 words. Tone: [confident/polite/formal].
```

**Polite no:**
```
Write an email politely declining [REQUEST] from [PERSON]. 
Offer [ALTERNATIVE]. Keep relationship intact.
```

**Follow-up:**
```
Write a follow-up email about [TOPIC]. Original email sent [WHEN]. 
Goal: [get response/schedule meeting/close deal]. Not pushy.
```

**Bad news:**
```
Write an email delivering bad news: [SITUATION]. 
To: [PERSON/ROLE]. Include: [next steps/explanation]. 
Tone: Direct but empathetic.
```

**Thank you:**
```

Mention [POSITIVE OUTCOME]. Genuine, not generic.
```

## The 60-Second Email Workflow

1. **Prompt** (15 sec): Copy template, fill in brackets
2. **Generate** (5 sec): Let AI draft
3. **Edit** (30 sec): Add specifics, fix tone, make it yours
4. **Send** (10 sec): Quick final read, hit send

What used to take 10 minutes now takes 1. Multiply by dozens of emails weekly.
