faq:
  - question: "Is Obsidian really free?"
    answer: "Yes, Obsidian is free for personal use. You only pay for optional add-ons: Sync ($4/mo), Publish ($8/mo), and Commercial license ($50/year). AI plugins are separate and have their own costs."
  - question: "Does Notion AI work offline?"
    answer: "No, Notion AI requires an internet connection. Notion itself has limited offline support, but AI features need to be online. Obsidian with local AI plugins can work completely offline."
  - question: "Can I switch from Notion to Obsidian?"
    answer: "Yes, but it's not seamless. Notion exports to Markdown, which Obsidian can import. However, Notion databases, relations, and complex formatting may need manual cleanup."

Notion and Obsidian represent two fundamentally different philosophies of note-taking. Now both have AI capabilities, making the choice even more interesting.

Notion AI is polished and integrated. Obsidian's AI is flexible and privacy-focused. Let's break down which approach works better for different needs.

## The Fundamental Difference

Before comparing AI features, understand what makes these apps different:

**Notion:**
- Cloud-based, collaborative
- Databases and structured content
- All-in-one workspace (docs, wikis, projects)
- Proprietary format
- Company controls your data

**Obsidian:**
- Local-first, your files on your device
- Plain Markdown files
- Pure note-taking (plugins add features)
- Open format (just .md files)
- You control your data

This fundamental difference shapes everything about their AI implementations.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Notion AI | Obsidian AI (Plugins) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Price | $10/mo add-on | Free - $20/mo (varies) |
| Setup | One click | Requires configuration |
| Privacy | Cloud processed | Can be local |
| Integration | Native, seamless | Plugin-dependent |
| Offline AI | No | Yes (with local models) |
| Learning curve | Easy | Moderate to steep |
| Collaboration | Excellent | Limited |

## Notion AI: The Polished Option

### What You Get

Notion AI is a $10/month add-on to any Notion plan (including free). It adds AI capabilities throughout the app:

**Writing Assistance**
- Generate drafts from prompts
- Continue writing from where you left off
- Translate content
- Fix spelling and grammar
- Change tone (professional, casual, etc.)
- Make text longer or shorter

**Content Transformation**
- Summarize pages
- Extract action items
- Create tables from text
- Convert bullet points to paragraphs (and vice versa)
- Explain technical content simply

**Q&A About Your Workspace**
- Ask questions about your notes
- "What did we decide about the Q3 budget?"
- "Summarize my meeting notes from last week"
- Search across your entire workspace with AI

**Database Features**
- Auto-fill properties
- Generate descriptions
- Summarize linked pages

### Notion AI Strengths

**Seamless Integration**
AI is built into every text block. Highlight text, press a shortcut, and AI options appear. No context switching.

**Workspace-Wide Q&A**
This is Notion AI's killer feature. Ask questions about anything in your workspace, and it finds and synthesizes answers. Game-changer for large knowledge bases.

**Zero Configuration**
Click a button, pay $10/month, done. No API keys, no setup, no technical knowledge required.

**Collaborative**
AI-generated content is visible to all workspace members. Great for teams.

### Notion AI Weaknesses

**Cloud Dependency**
Everything is processed on Notion's servers. Your notes, your prompts, your AI queries — all sent to the cloud.

**Cost Adds Up**
$10/user/month. For a team of 10, that's $100/month just for AI, plus Notion subscription costs.

**Limited Customization**
You can't choose models, adjust parameters, or use custom prompts. You get what Notion provides.

**Vendor Lock-in**
Your notes are in Notion's format. AI features only work within Notion. Switching apps means losing AI capabilities.

**No Offline AI**
No internet = no AI features.

## Obsidian AI: The Flexible Option

Obsidian doesn't have built-in AI. Instead, you add AI through community plugins. This gives you flexibility but requires more setup.

### Popular AI Plugins

**Copilot (Most Popular)**
- Chat with AI about your notes
- Generate text in your vault
- Supports OpenAI, Claude, local models
- Free plugin, pay for API usage

**Smart Connections**
- Find related notes automatically
- AI-powered linking suggestions
- Semantic search across your vault
- Works with local embeddings

**Text Generator**
- Generate text from prompts
- Templates for common tasks
- Multiple model support
- Free plugin, pay for API

**Ollama Integration**
- Run AI models locally
- Complete privacy (nothing leaves your device)
- Free (just your electricity)
- Requires decent hardware

### Obsidian AI Strengths

**Privacy Options**
Run AI completely locally with Ollama. Your notes never leave your device. For sensitive content, this is huge.

**Model Choice**
Use OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Llama, or any other model. Switch based on task or preference. Not locked to one provider.

**Cost Control**
Pay only for what you use. Heavy user? Consider local models. Light user? API costs might be pennies per month.

**Customization**
Create custom prompts, adjust temperature, set system instructions. Power users can fine-tune everything.

**Works Offline**
With local models (Ollama), AI works without internet. Great for travel or privacy-sensitive environments.

**No Lock-in**
Your notes are Markdown files. Plugins are optional. Switch apps anytime without losing your content.

### Obsidian AI Weaknesses

**Setup Required**
Nothing works out of the box. You need to:
1. Find and install plugins
2. Configure API keys or local models
3. Learn plugin-specific interfaces
4. Troubleshoot when things break

**Fragmented Experience**
Different plugins have different interfaces, different capabilities, different quality. No unified AI experience.

**No Native Q&A Across Vault**
Plugins attempt this, but nothing matches Notion AI's workspace-wide Q&A. The experience is clunkier.

**Plugin Maintenance**
Community plugins can break after updates, be abandoned by developers, or have security issues.

**Collaboration Limitations**
Obsidian is fundamentally single-user. Sharing AI features with a team is awkward at best.

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Notion AI If:

**You're a team**
Notion's collaboration + AI is unmatched. Shared workspaces with AI-powered search and summarization.

**You want simplicity**
No configuration, no maintenance, just AI that works.

**You already use Notion**
Adding AI to existing Notion workflow is trivial.

**You need workspace-wide Q&A**
"What did we decide about X?" across thousands of pages is Notion AI's superpower.

**You don't have privacy concerns**
Cloud processing is fine for your content.

### Choose Obsidian AI If:

**Privacy matters**
Medical notes, legal documents, personal journals — keep it local.

**You want control**
Choose your models, customize prompts, own your workflow.

**You're technical**
Comfortable with plugins, APIs, and occasional troubleshooting.

**You're budget-conscious**
Local models are free. API usage can be cheaper than flat fees.

**You use Obsidian already**
AI plugins enhance rather than replace your existing setup.

**You work offline frequently**
Local AI works anywhere, no internet required.

### Consider Both If:

Some users maintain both:
- Obsidian for personal notes (privacy, local)
- Notion for team collaboration (shared workspace, AI Q&A)

Not ideal, but addresses different needs.

---

## The Privacy Question

Let's be direct about privacy:

**Notion AI:**
- Your notes are on Notion's servers (already true without AI)
- AI queries send content to OpenAI (Notion's AI partner)
- Notion's privacy policy covers this
- Enterprise plans have additional protections

**Obsidian with Cloud AI (OpenAI, Claude APIs):**
- Your notes stay local
- Only content you send to AI leaves your device
- You choose what to send
- API providers have their own policies

**Obsidian with Local AI (Ollama):**
- Everything stays on your device
- No data transmission whatsoever
- Complete privacy
- You need capable hardware

For truly sensitive content, Obsidian + local AI is the only option that guarantees privacy.

## Setting Up Obsidian AI

If you want to try Obsidian's AI capabilities, here's the quick path:

### Option 1: Cloud AI (Easiest)

1. Install "Copilot" plugin from Community Plugins
2. Get OpenAI API key from platform.openai.com
3. Add API key to Copilot settings
4. Start chatting with your notes

**Cost:** Pay-per-use, typically $1-10/month for normal usage

### Option 2: Local AI (Most Private)

1. Install Ollama (ollama.ai)
2. Download a model: `ollama pull llama3`
3. Install "Copilot" or "Ollama" plugin
4. Configure to use local endpoint
5. Run AI completely offline

**Cost:** Free (electricity only)
**Requires:** 8GB+ RAM, decent CPU (GPU helps)

---

## The Verdict

**Notion AI is better for:**
- Teams and collaboration
- Non-technical users
- Heavy workspace-wide search needs
- All-in-one workspace fans

**Obsidian AI is better for:**
- Privacy-conscious individuals
- Technical power users
- Budget optimization
- Offline requirements
- Customization needs

### My Recommendation

**For most people:** Start with Notion AI. It's easier, more polished, and the workspace Q&A alone is worth $10/month if you have lots of notes.

**For privacy-sensitive use:** Obsidian + Ollama. The setup is worth it for complete control over your data.

**For power users:** Obsidian with carefully chosen plugins. The flexibility is unmatched, but budget time for configuration.

Both are excellent choices. The "right" answer depends on whether you prioritize convenience (Notion) or control (Obsidian).
