faq:
  - question: "Are mechanical keyboards worth it for office work?"
    answer: "Yes, if you type a lot. The improved tactile feedback reduces fatigue during long typing sessions. Just choose quieter switches (like Cherry MX Brown or Silent Reds) to avoid annoying coworkers."
  - question: "Why are mechanical keyboards so expensive?"
    answer: "Quality switches, better build materials, and durability. A mechanical keyboard can last 10+ years with 50-100 million keystrokes per switch. Budget options start around $50, which is comparable to decent membrane keyboards."
  - question: "What's the difference between mechanical and membrane keyboards?"
    answer: "Mechanical keyboards have individual switches under each key, providing better feedback and durability. Membrane keyboards use a rubber dome sheet, which is cheaper but mushier to type on and wears out faster."

You've heard people rave about mechanical keyboards. The satisfying click-clack. The premium typing feel. The rabbit hole of switches, keycaps, and custom builds.

But you just want a good keyboard that feels nice to type on. Without spending $300 or learning a new vocabulary.

This guide is for you.

## What Makes Mechanical Keyboards Different?

Regular keyboards (membrane keyboards) use a rubber dome under each key. Press down, rubber squishes, key registers. It works, but the feel is mushy and imprecise.

Mechanical keyboards have individual mechanical switches under each key. Each switch is a tiny precision mechanism with a spring, stem, and housing. The result: consistent feel, tactile feedback, and durability measured in decades.

**The benefits:**
- Better typing feel and feedback
- More accurate key presses
- Last 5-10x longer than membrane keyboards
- Satisfying sound (if you want it)
- Customizable (switches, keycaps, everything)

**The trade-offs:**
- More expensive
- Louder (usually)
- Heavier
- Can become an expensive hobby

## Understanding Switches (The Simple Version)

Switches determine how your keyboard feels and sounds. There are three main types:

### Linear Switches (Smooth)
- **Feel:** Smooth press from top to bottom
- **Sound:** Quiet to moderate
- **Best for:** Gaming, fast typing, quiet offices
- **Popular option:** Cherry MX Red, Gateron Red

### Tactile Switches (Bump)
- **Feel:** Small bump halfway through the press
- **Sound:** Moderate
- **Best for:** Typing, programming, general use
- **Popular option:** Cherry MX Brown, Gateron Brown

### Clicky Switches (Click + Bump)
- **Feel:** Bump with an audible click
- **Sound:** LOUD
- **Best for:** People who live alone or have understanding coworkers
- **Popular option:** Cherry MX Blue, Kailh Box White

**For beginners:** Start with **tactile (Brown switches)**. They're versatile, not too loud, and give satisfying feedback without being obnoxious.

## Keyboard Sizes Explained

Mechanical keyboards come in different sizes. Smaller isn't always better — pick based on what keys you actually use.

### Full Size (100%)
- All keys: number pad, function row, navigation cluster
- Best for: Data entry, spreadsheets, people who use the numpad
- Width: ~17-18 inches

### Tenkeyless / TKL (80%)
- Removes the number pad
- Keeps function row and navigation keys
- Best for: Most people, more desk space, still has all essential keys
- Width: ~14-15 inches

### 75%
- Compact function row and navigation
- Keys are closer together
- Best for: Those who want compact but still need function keys
- Width: ~12-13 inches

### 65%
- No function row
- Small navigation cluster
- Best for: Minimalists who can use Fn key combinations
- Width: ~12 inches

### 60%
- No function row, no navigation keys, no arrow keys
- Everything through Fn key combinations
- Best for: Enthusiasts, extreme minimalists, people who've memorized shortcuts
- Width: ~11 inches

**For beginners:** Start with **TKL (80%)** or **75%**. You get more desk space without losing functionality.

## What About Cherry MX vs Others?

Cherry MX is the original mechanical switch brand. They're good. But they're no longer the only option.

**Other excellent switch brands:**
- **Gateron:** Smoother than Cherry, often cheaper
- **Kailh:** Great variety, good value
- **Akko:** Budget-friendly, surprisingly good
- **Durock/JWK:** Enthusiast-grade smoothness

For beginners, don't stress about switch brands. Cherry MX Brown, Gateron Brown, or any "Brown equivalent" will serve you well.

If your keyboard is hot-swappable, you can try different switches later without buying a new board.

## Things Beginners Should Ignore (For Now)

The mechanical keyboard community loves going deep. But as a beginner, don't worry about:

- Lubing switches (makes them smoother)
- Stabilizer mods (reduces rattle on big keys)
- Custom keycap sets (expensive rabbit hole)
- Building a keyboard from scratch
- Sound profiles and foam mods
- Artisan keycaps ($50+ for a single key)

Get a solid keyboard, use it for 6 months, then decide if you want to go deeper.

## What to Look For

When shopping, prioritize:

1. **Hot-swappable switches** — Try different switches without soldering
2. **USB-C connection** — Modern standard, cables are everywhere
3. **PBT keycaps** — More durable than ABS, won't get shiny
4. **Good reviews for build quality** — Avoid flex and rattle
5. **Mac/Windows compatibility** — If you use both

## Tips for Your First Mechanical Keyboard

1. **Try before you buy** — Visit a store or buy a switch tester ($10-15)
2. **Start with Brown switches** — Good middle ground
3. **Get TKL size** — Best balance of size and functionality
4. **Budget $50-120** — Sweet spot for quality/value
5. **Don't cheap out too much** — Sub-$40 boards often have issues

## The Bottom Line

A good mechanical keyboard makes typing more enjoyable. You'll feel the difference immediately.

For most beginners: **Keychron K8 Pro with Brown switches**. It's versatile, well-built, and hot-swappable so you can experiment later.

On a budget? **Royal Kludge RK87**. Remarkable value, and good enough to know if you want to invest more later.
