## The Multi-Tool Approach

Here's a secret: most power users don't pick one AI. They use several.

**My recommendation:**
- **Primary:** Claude or ChatGPT for daily tasks
- **Research:** Perplexity for anything needing sources
- **Backup:** Gemini (free, unlimited) when you hit limits

This way you get the best of each tool without being dependent on any single one.

## Switching Costs

Worried about switching from ChatGPT?

**What you might lose:**
- Custom GPTs you've built
- Conversation history
- Memory settings

**What you keep:**
- Your skills (prompting works across tools)
- Your workflows (easily adaptable)

Most AI tools work similarly. The skills you've built transfer.

---

## The Bottom Line

ChatGPT is the default for a reason—it's a great all-rounder. But alternatives exist because they do specific things better.

- Need better writing? **Claude**
- Need citations? **Perplexity**  
- Need free unlimited? **Gemini**
- Need Microsoft integration? **Copilot**
- Need privacy? **Ollama**

Try a few. Most have free tiers. You might find something that fits your workflow better—or you might appreciate ChatGPT more. Either way, you win.
