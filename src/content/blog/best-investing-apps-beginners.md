faq:
  - question: "What is the best investing app for a complete beginner?"
    answer: "Fidelity is the best overall investing app for beginners. It has no account minimums, no commissions on stocks and ETFs, fractional shares starting at $1, and one of the best educational libraries in the industry. It won StockBrokers.com's 2026 award for best broker for beginners. If you want something simpler and fully automated, Acorns is the easiest starting point — it invests your spare change automatically."
  - question: "How much money do I need to start investing with an app?"
    answer: "Most investing apps in 2026 have no minimum deposit requirement. Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood, SoFi, and Webull all let you open an account with $0. Fractional shares let you start investing with as little as $1 on Fidelity and Robinhood, or $5 on Schwab, Webull, and SoFi. Acorns requires a $5 minimum investment. Vanguard has no account minimum but some mutual funds require $1,000 or more."
  - question: "Are investing apps safe to use?"
    answer: "Yes, all seven apps in this guide are regulated by FINRA and the SEC, and your investments are protected by SIPC insurance up to $500,000 (including $250,000 in cash). This means if the brokerage fails, your assets are covered. However, SIPC does not protect against investment losses — if a stock drops 50%, that's your risk. Always verify that any investing app is SIPC-insured before depositing money."

You know that moment at 2 PM when you've finished your actual work, you're "monitoring your inbox," and you start wondering whether now is a good time to finally start investing?

That was me about two years ago. I had money sitting in a savings account earning basically nothing, a vague sense that I should be doing *something* with it, and absolutely no idea where to start.

So I did what any reasonable person would do — I downloaded every investing app I could find and spent way too much of my work hours comparing them.

Here's what I learned: the "best" app depends entirely on what kind of investor you want to be. The person who wants to set it and forget it needs a completely different app than the person who wants to actively pick stocks during their lunch break.

If you want to [practice with fake money first](/best-paper-trading-apps/) (honestly a smart move), do that. If you want to [learn the fundamentals](/best-free-investing-courses/) before committing real cash, even better. But if you're ready to start with actual money, these are the seven apps worth your time.

## 1. Fidelity — Best Overall for Beginners

**Commissions:** $0 stocks/ETFs, $0.65/options contract | **Minimum:** $0 | **Fractional Shares:** Yes, from $1

If I had to recommend one app to someone who's never invested before, it's Fidelity. No contest.

### Why It Stands Out

Fidelity won StockBrokers.com's 2026 award for best broker for beginners, and after using it extensively, I understand why. The mobile app is clean without being dumbed down. You get access to fractional shares on over 7,000 stocks and ETFs starting at just $1. There are no account minimums, no commissions on stocks and ETFs, and no hidden fees that'll surprise you three months in.

But the real differentiator is education. Fidelity's learning center is organized around "Life Events" — retirement, buying a house, starting to invest — which makes way more sense than the usual wall of jargon-filled articles. Their research tools are excellent too, pulling from multiple third-party sources.

They also offer zero-expense-ratio index funds (the Fidelity ZERO funds), which means you can invest in a diversified portfolio and literally pay nothing in fees. No other broker matches that.

### What's Missing

The app can feel cluttered at times. Fidelity has been around since 1946, and sometimes the interface shows its age. It's not ugly — it's just not as sleek as Robinhood. Also, crypto trading is available but limited compared to dedicated crypto platforms.

### Who It's For

Anyone who wants a reliable, full-featured brokerage that won't charge them unnecessary fees. If you're opening your first investment account and plan to buy a mix of stocks, ETFs, and index funds, start here.

## 2. Charles Schwab — Best for Education and Tools

**Commissions:** $0 stocks/ETFs, $0.65/options contract | **Minimum:** $0 | **Fractional Shares:** Yes ($5 min via Stock Slices)

Schwab is the platform you grow into. It's beginner-friendly on the surface, but there's serious depth underneath for when you're ready.

### Why It Stands Out

After acquiring TD Ameritrade, Schwab inherited the legendary thinkorswim trading platform — and they've made it available to all clients for free. You don't need to use thinkorswim right away (the standard Schwab app is perfectly fine for beginners), but knowing it's there when you're ready to level up is a genuine advantage.

Schwab's Stock Slices let you buy fractional shares of any S&P 500 company for as little as $5, and you can buy up to 30 slices in a single transaction. Their educational content is extensive, with live webinars, on-demand courses, and a surprisingly good YouTube channel.

The paperMoney feature in thinkorswim deserves a special mention — it's a full [paper trading simulator](/best-paper-trading-apps/) with $100,000 in virtual cash, real-time data, and access to stocks, options, futures, and forex. If you want to practice before risking real money, it's one of the best simulators available.

### What's Missing

Stock Slices are limited to S&P 500 companies — you can't buy fractional shares of smaller stocks. The thinkorswim platform, while powerful, can be overwhelming if you're brand new. Stick with the standard Schwab mobile app until you're comfortable.

### Who It's For

Beginners who take learning seriously and want room to grow. If you see yourself eventually getting into options or more advanced strategies, Schwab gives you the tools without needing to switch platforms later.

---

## 3. Robinhood — Best for Simplicity

**Commissions:** $0 stocks/ETFs, $0.50/options contract ($0.35 with Gold) | **Minimum:** $0 | **Fractional Shares:** Yes, from $1

Love it or hate it, Robinhood made investing accessible to an entire generation. And despite the controversies, the app itself is genuinely good for beginners.

### Why It Stands Out

The interface is the cleanest in the industry. Period. Where other apps bombard you with data, Robinhood shows you exactly what you need and nothing more. For someone who's intimidated by investing, this simplicity matters more than any advanced feature.

Fractional shares start at $1, so you can own a piece of Amazon or Tesla without needing hundreds of dollars. The IRA offering includes a match — Gold members get a 3% boost on annual IRA contributions (up to ~$225 based on 2026 limits), which is essentially free money.

Robinhood Gold ($5/month or $50/year) adds Morningstar research reports, 3.35% APY on uninvested cash (as of February 2026), Level II market data, and discounted options commissions.

### What's Missing

Educational resources are thin compared to Fidelity or Schwab. The simplicity that makes Robinhood great for getting started can also hold you back as you learn more. There's no paper trading feature, and the research tools are basic unless you pay for Gold.

The app's gamified design — confetti on trades, for instance — has been criticized for encouraging impulsive trading. Something to be aware of.

### Who It's For

People who want to start investing with minimal friction. If the thought of opening a Fidelity account feels like filing taxes, Robinhood gets you from download to first trade in about five minutes.

---

## 4. Vanguard — Best for Long-Term Index Investing

**Commissions:** $0 stocks/ETFs | **Minimum:** $0 (account), varies for funds | **Fractional Shares:** Yes, from $1

If your investing strategy is "buy index funds and don't touch them for 20 years," Vanguard is your spiritual home.

### Why It Stands Out

Vanguard essentially invented low-cost index investing. Their average expense ratio across all funds and ETFs is just 0.06% — that's 84% lower than the industry average. When you're investing for decades, those small percentage differences compound into thousands of dollars saved.

In early 2026, Vanguard cut fees on 53 mutual funds and ETFs, continuing their tradition of passing savings back to investors. The company's unique ownership structure (it's owned by the funds themselves, which are owned by investors) means they're not trying to maximize profits at your expense.

The Digital Advisor robo-service starts at just $100 with an advisory fee of up to 0.20% annually (with the first 90 days fee-free), making it accessible for beginners who want professional portfolio management without the $50,000+ minimums of traditional advisors.

### What's Missing

Let's be honest — the app and website feel dated. Vanguard has improved the mobile experience, but it still lags behind Robinhood, Webull, and even Fidelity in terms of interface polish. If you want real-time charts and advanced trading tools, look elsewhere.

Account service fees of $25/year per brokerage account apply, though you can eliminate them by signing up for e-delivery of statements.

Some mutual funds require minimums of $1,000 or more, which can be a barrier for beginners. However, Vanguard ETFs can be purchased for as little as $1 through fractional shares.

### Who It's For

Patient investors who believe in the "buy and hold" philosophy. If you've read anything by Jack Bogle, Warren Buffett's advice about index funds, or the Bogleheads philosophy, Vanguard is where those ideas come to life. Not flashy, but quietly effective.

## 5. SoFi Invest — Best for All-in-One Finance

**Commissions:** $0 stocks/ETFs | **Minimum:** $0 | **Fractional Shares:** Yes, from $5

SoFi isn't just an investing app — it's a full financial platform. Banking, investing, loans, and credit cards all live under one roof.

### Why It Stands Out

The all-in-one approach genuinely makes life simpler. Your SoFi Checking and Savings account (up to 3.30% APY with eligible direct deposit, or up to 4.00% APY for SoFi Plus members) sits right next to your investment account. Moving money between saving and investing takes seconds.

SoFi gives every member one free session with a financial planner — a genuinely useful perk for beginners who want human guidance. SoFi Plus members can schedule unlimited sessions.

IPO access is another standout feature. SoFi lets everyday investors participate in IPOs at the offering price, before shares start trading on the exchange. Most brokers reserve this for high-net-worth clients.

The automated investing option (robo-advisor) charges zero management fees, which makes it one of the cheapest robo-advisors available.

### What's Missing

The research and charting tools are basic. If you want detailed technical analysis or advanced screeners, you'll need to supplement with something like a [dedicated stock screener](/best-free-stock-screeners/). Fractional shares require a $5 minimum, which is higher than Fidelity's or Robinhood's $1 minimum.

There's also a $25 inactivity fee if you don't log in for six months, which is annoying but easy to avoid.

### Who It's For

People who want to simplify their entire financial life in one app. If you're currently juggling separate apps for banking, saving, and investing, SoFi consolidates everything. Especially appealing if you also have student loans (SoFi started as a student loan refinancer).

## 6. Webull — Best for Active Beginners

**Commissions:** $0 stocks/ETFs/options | **Minimum:** $0 | **Fractional Shares:** Yes, from $1

Webull sits in an interesting middle ground — more advanced than Robinhood, less overwhelming than thinkorswim. If you're a beginner who wants to actually learn how to analyze stocks rather than just buy and hold, Webull is compelling.

### Why It Stands Out

The charting tools are surprisingly powerful for a free app. You get dozens of technical indicators, drawing tools, and real-time data that would cost money on other platforms. Extended-hours trading runs from 4 AM to 8 PM ET — much wider than most competitors — with no additional fees.

Webull's [paper trading feature](/best-paper-trading-apps/) is one of the best available. You get unlimited virtual cash with real-time market data, which lets you practice strategies without risking a dime. I've recommended it as a starting point for anyone curious about active trading.

The platform also offers commission-free options trading (a $0.55 fee applies to non-equity options), futures, and crypto, giving you plenty of room to explore as your knowledge grows.

### What's Missing

Educational resources are improving but still not on par with Fidelity or Schwab. Fractional shares start at $1 and are available on select stocks and ETFs. There's also a $75 fee for outbound account transfers (ACATS), which is worth knowing if you decide to switch brokers later.

Crypto trading carries a 1% spread, which is higher than dedicated crypto exchanges.

### Who It's For

Beginners who lean toward active trading and want to learn technical analysis. If you find yourself reading about moving averages and RSI indicators during slow work hours, Webull gives you the tools to actually put that knowledge into practice — with paper trading first, then real money when you're ready.

## 7. Acorns — Best for Automated Investing

**Commissions:** N/A (managed portfolio) | **Minimum:** $5 | **Fractional Shares:** Automated

Acorns takes a completely different approach: you don't pick stocks at all. The app invests your spare change automatically, and a robo-advisor manages everything.

### Why It Stands Out

The Round-Ups feature is genuinely clever. Link a debit or credit card, and every purchase gets rounded up to the nearest dollar. That spare change accumulates, and once it hits $5, Acorns automatically invests it into a diversified portfolio of low-cost ETFs based on your risk tolerance.

Buy a $3.50 coffee? Acorns rounds up to $4.00 and invests the $0.50. You can even set a multiplier (2x to 10x) to accelerate your investing. It's painless, automatic, and you barely notice the money leaving.

The portfolios themselves are solid — diversified across domestic stocks, international stocks, bonds, and real estate ETFs. Acorns handles all the rebalancing automatically.

Gold members get a 3% match on new IRA contributions during the first year, plus $10,000 in life insurance, a no-cost will, and custodial accounts for kids.

### What's Missing

Here's the honest truth: Acorns' fees are a bad deal if your balance is small. The Bronze plan costs $3/month, Silver is $6/month, and Gold is $12/month. If you have $500 invested, that $3/month fee works out to 7.2% annually — dramatically higher than any other app on this list.

The math only starts making sense once your balance grows. At $5,000, the Bronze fee drops to ~0.72% annually, which is more reasonable. At $10,000+, it becomes competitive.

You also can't pick individual stocks on the Bronze or Silver plans (Gold adds that option), and you have no control over which specific ETFs are in your portfolio.

### Who It's For

People who know they'll never actively manage investments. If the idea of picking stocks, analyzing charts, or even choosing an index fund feels overwhelming, Acorns removes every decision except "how much risk can you handle?" It's the investing equivalent of setting up automatic bill pay — you configure it once and forget about it.

## What to Look for in a Beginner Investing App

Not all free investing apps are created equal. Here's what actually matters when you're starting out:

### Fees and Commissions

Every app on this list offers $0 commissions on stocks and ETFs, which is now the industry standard. But watch for:

- **Options contract fees** ($0.35-$0.65 per contract depending on the broker)
- **Account maintenance fees** (Vanguard charges $25/year, waivable with e-delivery)
- **Subscription fees** (Acorns $3-12/month, Robinhood Gold $5/month)
- **Transfer fees** (Webull charges $75 for outbound transfers)
- **Inactivity fees** (SoFi charges $25 after 6 months of no login)

### Fractional Shares

This is non-negotiable for beginners. Fractional shares let you invest $5 or $10 into expensive stocks instead of needing $200+ for a single share. Fidelity and Robinhood have the lowest minimums at $1.

### Educational Resources

If you're truly starting from zero, the quality of educational content matters. Fidelity and Schwab are leagues ahead of everyone else. Both offer structured learning paths, live webinars, and content that's actually written for beginners. If you want to [build a solid foundation first](/best-free-investing-courses/), take advantage of these free resources.

### Account Types

At minimum, you want access to:

- **Individual brokerage account** — standard taxable investing
- **Roth IRA** — tax-free growth for retirement
- **Traditional IRA** — tax-deferred retirement investing

All seven apps offer these. Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard also offer HSAs, 529 plans, and trust accounts if you need them later.

### Ease of Use

Be honest with yourself. If a complicated interface will stop you from ever opening the app, pick Robinhood or SoFi. You can always switch later. The best investing app is the one you'll actually use.

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

I've made most of these. Learn from my experience.

### Chasing Meme Stocks and Hype

That stock your coworker won't shut up about? The one that's "definitely going to the moon"? Maybe it will. But it probably won't, and if you're investing money you can't afford to lose based on Reddit threads, you're gambling, not investing.

Start with broad index funds (like a total market ETF) and get comfortable with how markets move before buying individual stocks.

### No Diversification

Putting all your money into one stock — even a "safe" one — is how people lose their shirts. A simple three-fund portfolio (U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds) gives you exposure to thousands of companies across the globe for minimal effort.

### Checking Your Portfolio Too Often

This is the biggest trap for office workers. You have the app on your phone, you're bored, you check it every 30 minutes. The market drops 1.5% and you panic-sell. Then it recovers the next day.

Set your investments and check them weekly at most. Monthly is even better. The data consistently shows that the less frequently investors check their portfolios, the better their returns.

### Ignoring Tax Implications

Selling investments within a year triggers short-term capital gains tax (taxed as regular income). Holding for over a year qualifies for lower long-term capital gains rates. If you're going to buy and sell frequently, do it in a Roth IRA where gains aren't taxed.

This isn't financial advice — talk to a tax professional about your specific situation.

---

## The Bored at Work Angle

Let's be real — half the reason you're reading this is because you have downtime at the office. Here's how to manage investments during work hours without raising eyebrows:

**Use a browser-based platform during work.** Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard all have full-featured web apps that look like "financial research" if someone glances at your screen. Much more professional-looking than a mobile app.

**Set up automated investing.** Acorns runs entirely on autopilot. Fidelity and Vanguard offer recurring investment schedules. Configure them once, and your money invests itself whether you're paying attention or not.

**Do your research during slow hours, execute trades on your own time.** Reading earnings reports, comparing ETFs, and browsing through your [stock screener](/best-free-stock-screeners/) is essentially financial education. Actually placing trades can wait until lunch or after hours.

**Use extended-hours trading.** Webull lets you trade from 4 AM to 8 PM ET. If you're an early riser or a night owl, you can manage your portfolio outside of work entirely.

Looking for more ways to use your downtime productively? I've got a whole list of [productive things to do when you're bored at work](/productive-things-bored-at-work/) — investing is just one of them.

## My Recommendation by Use Case

After using all seven, here's who I'd point where:

| If You Want... | Use This | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| The best all-around experience | **Fidelity** | Zero fees, zero minimums, excellent education, room to grow |
| Maximum simplicity | **Robinhood** | Cleanest interface, lowest friction, $1 fractional shares |
| Serious learning tools | **Charles Schwab** | thinkorswim + paperMoney + extensive education library |
| Set-and-forget investing | **Acorns** | Fully automated, spare change round-ups, zero decisions |
| Long-term index funds | **Vanguard** | Lowest-cost funds, buy-and-hold philosophy baked in |
| One app for all finances | **SoFi** | Banking + investing + loans under one roof |
| Active trading practice | **Webull** | Best free charts, paper trading, extended hours |

If you're truly starting from scratch, go with **Fidelity**. It does everything well, charges nothing, and won't hold you back as you learn more. Open a Roth IRA, set up a recurring investment into a total market index fund, and you'll be ahead of most people within a month.

And if you're not ready for real money yet, start with [paper trading](/best-paper-trading-apps/) — no risk, real market data, and you'll learn faster than reading any article (including this one).
