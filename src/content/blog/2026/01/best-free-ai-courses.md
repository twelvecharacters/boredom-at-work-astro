AI skills are the most in-demand professional skills of 2026. LinkedIn's workforce report puts AI literacy at the top of the list. Employers want it. Career advancement requires it. And the good news? You can learn it for free during work downtime.

Most people think learning AI means expensive bootcamps or going back to school. It doesn't. The best AI courses are free, take under 10 hours, and are designed to be taken in short sessions—perfect for lunch breaks and slow afternoons.

Here's our curated list of the best free AI courses you can actually complete at your desk.

## What Makes a Good "At Work" Course?

Not every course is suitable for workplace learning. We looked for:

- **Short modules** - 15-30 minute chunks that fit into natural breaks
- **Text-based options** - Video is great, but text lets you learn without headphones
- **Certificate included** - Something to add to LinkedIn
- **Actually useful** - Practical skills, not just theory
- **Free or freemium** - No credit card required to start

All the courses below meet these criteria.
