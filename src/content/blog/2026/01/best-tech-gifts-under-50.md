- **TP-Link / Kasa** — Reliable smart home
- **Logitech** — Consistent peripherals
- **Spigen** — Phone cases that actually protect

### Brands to Avoid
- No-name Amazon brands with random letters
- Anything with reviews that seem fake
- "As seen on TV" tech products
- Suspiciously cheap versions of popular products

### Where to Buy
- **Amazon** — Widest selection, easy returns
- **Best Buy** — Good for price matching
- **Target** — Often has exclusives and sales
- **Directly from brand** — Sometimes better warranty

2. **Anker 10000mAh Power Bank ($25)** — Everyone needs portable power
3. **Echo Dot ($35-50)** — Fun to use, surprisingly useful

## What to Avoid

Some "popular" tech gifts that often disappoint:

- **Cheap smartwatches** — Usually garbage unless it's from a real brand
- **USB gadgets (mini fans, mini vacuums)** — Novelty wears off fast
- **No-name wireless chargers** — Slow, unreliable, sometimes dangerous
- **"Universal" adapters** — Often don't work well with anything
- **Drone under $100** — Save up or don't bother

## Wrapping Up

The best tech gifts solve a problem the recipient didn't know they had. Portable chargers get used constantly. Smart plugs become indispensable. Good earbuds replace bad ones.

Stick to trusted brands, prioritize practical over flashy, and you'll give something that actually gets used — not something that ends up in the regift pile.
