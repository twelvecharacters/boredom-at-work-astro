faq:
  - question: "What's the best camera for beginners?"
    answer: "The Canon EOS R100 (~$480) offers the best balance of price, features, and room to grow. If you can stretch to $600, consider a used Nikon Z50 for better performance."
  - question: "Should I buy a DSLR or mirrorless camera?"
    answer: "Mirrorless is the future and what manufacturers are investing in. Buy mirrorless unless you find an incredible deal on a used DSLR with lenses."
  - question: "Do I even need a camera if I have a good phone?"
    answer: "Phones are excellent for casual photography. Get a dedicated camera if you want more control, better low-light performance, or interchangeable lenses for specific needs."

So you want to get into photography. The internet is full of gear heads arguing about sensor sizes and autofocus points. Here's what actually matters when you're starting out.

## Do You Even Need a Camera?

Before spending money, let's be honest: your phone might be enough.

### Read This First

- **[Camera vs Smartphone](/camera-vs-smartphone/)** — When a dedicated camera actually makes sense

### Get a Camera If...

- You want control over depth of field (blurry backgrounds)
- You shoot in low light often
- You want to learn photography as a skill
- Your phone's zoom is frustrating you

### Stick With Your Phone If...

- You mostly share on social media
- You value convenience over control
- You're not sure photography is "your thing" yet

## Choosing Your First Camera

The most important decision: DSLR or mirrorless?

### Essential Reading

- **[DSLR vs Mirrorless for Beginners](/dslr-vs-mirrorless-beginners/)** — The complete breakdown
- **[Best Cameras Under $500](/best-cameras-under-500/)** — Budget-friendly options that don't compromise
- **[Best Cameras for Beginners](/best-cameras-for-beginners/)** — Starter recommendations

### The Short Answer

**Buy mirrorless.** DSLRs are being phased out. Mirrorless cameras are smaller, have better autofocus, and that's where all the new lenses are.

### Budget Breakdown

| Budget | Best Option |
|--------|-------------|
| Under $400 | Used Sony A6000 |
| $400-500 | Canon EOS R100 |
| $500-700 | Used Nikon Z50 |
| $700-1000 | Nikon Z50 II or Sony A6400 |

## Avoid Beginner Mistakes

Learning from others' mistakes saves money and frustration.

### Must-Read Guides

- **[Beginner Photography Mistakes](/beginner-photography-mistakes/)** — Don't waste money on these

### Common Mistakes

1. **Buying too much gear** — Start with the kit lens
2. **Obsessing over specs** — Technique matters more
3. **Ignoring the used market** — Save 30-50% on great gear
4. **Buying cheap tripods** — They break and wobble

## Buying from Japan

Some of the best camera deals are on the Japanese used market.

### Japan Import Guides

- **[How to Buy from Japan](/how-to-buy-from-japan-beginners-guide/)** — Complete proxy service guide
- **[Best Japanese Products to Import](/best-japanese-products-to-import/)** — Cameras are #1 on this list

### Why Japan?

- Japanese sellers grade condition honestly
- Vintage lenses are abundant
- Prices are often 20-40% lower
- Unique limited editions

## The Recommended Path

### Step 1: Start Cheap
Buy a used entry-level mirrorless (~$300-400). Learn the basics. Discover what you actually like shooting.

### Step 2: Identify Your Style
After 3-6 months, you'll know if you prefer:
- Portraits → Need fast prime lenses
- Landscapes → Need wide angle
- Street → Need compact body
- Wildlife → Need telephoto zoom

### Step 3: Upgrade Strategically
Sell your starter kit and buy gear that matches your style. Now you're spending money wisely instead of guessing.

## Budget Starter Kit

Here's what I'd buy with $600 today:

| Item | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Canon R100 + kit lens | $480 | New with warranty |
| Extra battery | $25 | Third-party is fine |
| SD card (128GB) | $20 | SanDisk Extreme |
| Camera bag | $30 | Don't overthink it |
| **Total** | **$555** | |

Leftover budget goes to a 50mm f/1.8 lens later.

## The Bottom Line

Photography gear can be a rabbit hole. Here's how to avoid it:

1. Buy one camera body
2. Use the kit lens for 6 months
3. Take 1000 photos before buying anything else
4. Only upgrade to solve a specific problem

The best camera is the one you actually use. Start simple, learn the craft, then spend money where it matters.
