So you've discovered that Japan has incredible deals on cameras, anime figures, vintage electronics, or unique stationery — but the websites are all in Japanese and don't ship to your country. Now what?

Don't worry. Buying from Japan is easier than it looks, and this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to make your first purchase.

## Why Buy from Japan?

Before we dive into the how, let's talk about the why:

**Better Prices:** Many items are significantly cheaper in Japan, especially used goods. The Japanese secondhand market is exceptional — people take care of their belongings, and you can find near-mint condition items at fraction of retail prices.

**Exclusive Products:** Japan-only releases, limited editions, and products that never made it to international markets. From vintage cameras to regional Kit-Kat flavors, some things you simply can't get elsewhere.

**Quality Selection:** Japan's culture of meticulous care means even "used" items are often in excellent condition. Sellers accurately describe flaws and package items carefully.

**Unique Finds:** Vintage electronics, retro gaming, traditional crafts, and niche hobbies — Japan has thriving markets for things that are hard to find anywhere else.

## The Challenge: Most Japanese Sites Don't Ship Internationally

Here's the catch: Amazon Japan, Yahoo Auctions, Mercari, Rakuten, and most other Japanese e-commerce sites either don't ship internationally or charge exorbitant fees to do so.

The solution? **Proxy services** and **forwarding services**.

## Understanding Your Options

### Option 1: Proxy Services (Recommended for Beginners)

A proxy service buys items on your behalf. You tell them what to buy, they purchase it, receive it at their warehouse, and ship it to you.

**Popular proxy services:**
- **Buyee** — Most beginner-friendly, official partnerships with major sites
- **Sendico** — Lower fees, good for experienced buyers
- **ZenMarket** — Good balance of features and fees
- **FromJapan** — Solid alternative with good customer service

**Best for:** Auction sites, Mercari, stores that require Japanese payment methods

### Option 2: Forwarding Services

A forwarding service gives you a Japanese address. You shop on websites yourself, ship items to that address, and the service forwards packages to you.

**Popular forwarding services:**
- **Tenso** — Long-established, reliable
- **Blackship** — Competitive pricing

**Best for:** Stores that accept international credit cards but don't ship overseas

### Option 3: Direct International Shipping

Some Japanese retailers do ship internationally:
- **Amazon Japan** — Many items ship directly (check the "International Shipping" filter)
- **CDJapan** — Music, anime, J-pop merchandise
- **AmiAmi** — Anime figures and collectibles
- **HLJ (HobbyLink Japan)** — Models, figures, toys

**Best for:** New products from established retailers

## Step-by-Step: Your First Japan Purchase

Let's walk through buying an item from Yahoo Auctions Japan using Buyee.

### Step 1: Create a Proxy Account

Go to [Buyee](https://buyee.jp) and create an account. You'll need:
- Email address
- Password
- Shipping address in your country

### Step 2: Find Your Item

Browse Yahoo Auctions Japan directly, or use Buyee's integrated search.

**Search tips:**
- Use Google Translate for Japanese keywords
- Search in both English and Japanese
- Check multiple categories

### Step 3: Check the Listing Carefully

Before bidding or buying, review:
- **Photos** — Look for damage, wear, missing parts
- **Description** — Use Google Translate; look for keywords like "junk" (ジャンク) which means "for parts"
- **Seller rating** — Higher is better; avoid sellers with many negative reviews
- **Shipping within Japan** — Some items have expensive domestic shipping

### Step 4: Place Your Bid or Buy

For auctions:
- Set your maximum bid (the system autobids up to your limit)
- Remember: proxy fees are added to your max bid
- Auctions can extend if bids come in the last minutes

For fixed-price items:
- Click "Buy Now" and proceed to checkout

### Step 5: Pay for the Item

Once you win or buy:
- Pay the item price + proxy service fee
- Choose domestic shipping options if applicable

### Step 6: Wait for Warehouse Arrival

Your item ships to the proxy's warehouse. This usually takes 1-5 days within Japan.

### Step 7: Choose International Shipping

When items arrive at the warehouse:
- **Consolidate packages** if you bought multiple items (saves money!)
- Choose your shipping method (see below)
- Pay for international shipping

### Step 8: Receive Your Package

Depending on shipping method:
- **Surface mail:** 4-8 weeks
- **Airmail:** 1-3 weeks
- **EMS:** 3-7 days
- **DHL/FedEx:** 2-5 days

## Understanding Shipping Options

| Method | Speed | Cost | Tracking | Best For |
|--------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| Surface | 4-8 weeks | $ | Limited | Heavy, non-urgent items |
| Airmail | 1-3 weeks | $$ | Basic | Light packages |
| EMS | 3-7 days | $$$ | Full | Valuable items |
| DHL/FedEx | 2-5 days | $$$$ | Full | Urgent purchases |

**Pro tip:** Shipping is calculated by weight OR dimensional weight (whichever is higher). A large, light package can cost more than expected.

## Customs and Import Duties

When your package arrives in your country, customs may:
- **Inspect the package** — Usually just a quick check
- **Charge import duties** — Based on item value and category
- **Charge handling fees** — Your postal service may charge a fee to process customs

**To minimize surprises:**
- Know your country's duty-free threshold (e.g., $800 in the US, €22-150 in EU)
- Declare accurate values (don't ask sellers to undervalue — it's illegal and risky)
- Some categories (electronics, clothing) may have specific duty rates

## Where to Buy: The Best Japanese Sites

### Yahoo Auctions Japan (ヤフオク)
Japan's biggest auction site. Incredible selection of used goods, vintage items, and collectibles.
- **Best for:** Cameras, electronics, collectibles, vintage items
- **How to buy:** Through proxy service (Buyee has official integration)

### Mercari Japan
Think eBay meets Craigslist. Fixed prices, easy transactions, lots of everyday items.
- **Best for:** Clothing, figures, games, everyday items
- **How to buy:** Through proxy service

### Rakuten
Japan's Amazon equivalent. Multiple sellers, new and used items.
- **Best for:** New products, Japanese brands, beauty products
- **How to buy:** Proxy service or some sellers ship internationally

### Amazon Japan
Familiar interface, some items ship internationally.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring seller ratings** — A seller with poor feedback is a red flag, even if the price is great.

2. **Forgetting domestic shipping** — That 1,000 yen item might have 2,000 yen shipping within Japan.

3. **Not consolidating packages** — Shipping multiple small packages is way more expensive than one combined shipment.

4. **Choosing the wrong shipping speed** — Express shipping on a cheap item can cost more than the item itself.

5. **Underestimating customs** — Budget for potential import duties, especially on expensive items.

6. **Bidding without research** — Check completed auctions to see what items actually sell for.

## Quick Checklist: Before You Buy

- [ ] Is the item in good condition? (Check all photos)
- [ ] What does the seller rating look like?
- [ ] What's the domestic shipping cost?
- [ ] Have I checked similar completed listings for price reference?
- [ ] Do I have enough in my proxy account for the purchase?
