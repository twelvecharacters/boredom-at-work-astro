tldr: "Better ANC, longer battery (8h vs 6h), more water resistant — but $279 isn't a must-upgrade from Pro 2. Worth it if you're buying new or your old AirPods are dying."

  priceRange: "$279"
faq:
  - question: "Are AirPods Pro 3 worth upgrading from AirPods Pro 2?"
    answer: "If your AirPods Pro 2 still work well, probably not. The improvements are incremental. But if you're coming from the original AirPods Pro or regular AirPods, it's a significant upgrade in sound quality and ANC."
  - question: "What's new in AirPods Pro 3?"
    answer: "Key improvements include an upgraded H2 chip with better ANC, improved sound quality with adaptive EQ, longer battery life (8 hours vs 6), better hearing health features, and a more durable design with IP57 rating."
  - question: "Do AirPods Pro 3 work with Android?"
    answer: "Yes, but you lose most smart features. No automatic ear detection, no seamless switching, no Spatial Audio. For Android users, Galaxy Buds or Sony earbuds offer better value."

I got AirPods Pro 3 as a gift last week. After daily use during commutes, work calls, and late-night music sessions, here are my honest first impressions.

Spoiler: Apple didn't reinvent the wheel. But they made the wheel noticeably better.

## What's Actually New

If you're familiar with AirPods Pro 2, the third generation feels familiar. Same general design, same case shape. Apple's "if it ain't broke" philosophy in action.

But under the hood:

| Feature | AirPods Pro 2 | AirPods Pro 3 |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Chip | H2 | H2 (upgraded) |
| Battery (buds) | 6 hours | 8 hours |
| Battery (case) | 30 hours | 24 hours |
| ANC | Excellent | Even better |
| Water resistance | IPX4 | IP57 |
| Price | $249 | $279 |

The $30 price bump stings a bit, but the improvements are real.

## Sound Quality: Noticeably Improved

The upgraded H2 chip brings better computational audio. What does that actually mean in practice?

**Bass is fuller without being muddy.** My test playlist (everything from Kendrick to Khruangbin) sounds more dynamic. The low end has more presence without drowning out mids.

**Spatial Audio is more convincing.** I was skeptical before, but watching Dolby Atmos content now actually feels immersive. The head tracking is smoother too.

**Adaptive EQ is smarter.** The earbuds adjust to your ear shape in real-time. Sounds like marketing speak, but I noticed the difference when switching between different ear tips.

## Noise Cancellation: The Real Upgrade

This is where the upgraded H2 chip shines.

The ANC on AirPods Pro 2 was already excellent. The third generation somehow blocks more noise while sounding more natural. Office chatter? Gone. Train rumble? Significantly reduced.

But here's what impressed me most: **Adaptive Audio mode**.

It's the new default mode that blends ANC and Transparency based on your environment. Walking on a quiet street? Mostly transparent. Step into a noisy café? ANC kicks in gradually.

After a week, I stopped manually switching modes. The automatic adjustment just works.

## Comfort and Fit

Same design, same fit. If AirPods Pro 2 fit your ears, these will too.

Apple now includes five ear tip sizes (XXS, XS, S, M, L) instead of four. The new XXS size is great for people who found even the small tips too big.

The new **IP57 rating** means better dust and water resistance. Not waterproof, but I'm less nervous about getting caught in the rain.

## Battery Life: Finally Better

The extra two hours of listening time (8 vs 6 hours) makes a real difference. My AirPods now easily survive my entire workday without needing a mid-day charge.

The case holds 24 hours of total charge with ANC enabled. Combined with the longer bud life, you'll still get through multiple days easily.

USB-C charging is faster too. 5 minutes in the case gives you about an hour of listening.

## The Hearing Health Features

Apple's pushing hearing health hard with this generation:

- **Hearing Test**: Built-in audiogram you can do with just the AirPods
- **Hearing Aid Mode**: For those with mild to moderate hearing loss
- **Hearing Protection**: Automatic volume limiting based on exposure

I'm not old enough to need hearing aids (yet), but the hearing test was surprisingly detailed. Good to have a baseline.

## What I Don't Love

**The price creep.** $279 for earbuds is a lot. The original AirPods Pro launched at $249.

**Still no lossless audio.** Bluetooth limitations mean you're not getting the full quality of Apple Music Lossless tracks. Disappointing for a premium product.

**Case scratches easily.** The glossy finish picks up micro-scratches within days. Get a case cover if you care about aesthetics.

**Find My requires the case.** You can locate the case, but individual earbuds still can't be tracked separately when outside the case.

## Who Should Buy These?

**Yes, if you:**
- Have original AirPods Pro (significant upgrade)
- Have regular AirPods and want ANC
- Are deep in the Apple ecosystem
- Take lots of calls (voice quality is excellent)

**Maybe wait, if you:**
- Have AirPods Pro 2 that work fine
- Primarily use Android (get Galaxy Buds instead)
- Want the absolute best sound (Sony WF-1000XM5 edges ahead)

**Skip entirely, if you:**
- Use Android as your main phone
- Are on a tight budget (plenty of good options under $100)
- Need workout earbuds (Beats Fit Pro might be better)

## Office Survival Guide

Real talk: these are work earbuds as much as commute earbuds. Here's how they perform in office reality:

**Open Office Life**

The ANC turns your chaotic open-plan into a focus bubble. That guy who takes every call on speaker? Gone. The facilities team's vacuum at 4pm? Reduced to a whisper.

**The "Are You Ignoring Me?" Problem**

Adaptive Audio actually solves this. When a coworker approaches or speaks up, transparency kicks in automatically. You hear them without removing earbuds.

Pro tip: Keep one earbud out during "available" hours. Universal signal that you're interruptible.

**Meeting Survival**

Call quality is genuinely excellent. Your voice cuts through clearly even in noisy environments. The mics know which sounds are you and which are background.

Just remember to mute when not speaking — they don't filter *your* keyboard clicks.

**The Work-From-Home MVP**

If you hybrid work, these shine. Same great audio at home, at the office, on the commute. One device, everywhere.

## The Verdict

AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods Apple has made. The ANC improvements alone justify the upgrade for frequent travelers or office workers. The extra battery life is a nice bonus.

But "best AirPods" doesn't mean "best earbuds." For pure audio quality, Sony still edges ahead. For Android users, Galaxy Buds offer better value.

If you're an iPhone user who wants earbuds that just work seamlessly, AirPods Pro 3 are the obvious choice. Apple's ecosystem integration remains unmatched.

Getting them as a gift? Even better. That's the best price point.
