faq:
  - question: "What's the most important desk upgrade?"
    answer: "A mechanical keyboard. You touch it all day, every day. A good one reduces fatigue, feels satisfying, and lasts for years. Start there."
  - question: "How much should I spend on desk upgrades?"
    answer: "Start with $100-150 for a quality keyboard. Add $150-250 for good earbuds. Beyond that, prioritize based on your needs. You don't need everything at once."
  - question: "Are expensive gadgets worth it for office work?"
    answer: "Sometimes. A $150 keyboard beats a $30 one for comfort and durability. But a $300 keyboard isn't necessarily better than a $100 one. Diminishing returns kick in fast."

Your desk is where you spend 8+ hours a day. Why settle for the cheapest keyboard IT handed you and earbuds that hurt after an hour?

This guide covers everything you need to build a workspace that's actually pleasant to use — without going overboard on unnecessary gear.

## Keyboards: The Foundation of Your Setup

You type thousands of words daily. A good keyboard isn't a luxury — it's an investment in your hands.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need to buy everything at once. Start with whatever bothers you most about your current setup:

One good upgrade beats five mediocre ones.
