faq:
  - question: "Can I get fired for using AI at work?"
    answer: "Yes, if you violate company policy or misuse AI (e.g., sharing confidential data, submitting AI work as your own without disclosure, or using AI for prohibited tasks). Most companies allow AI use within guidelines — check your policy."
  - question: "Do I have to tell my boss I'm using AI?"
    answer: "It depends on your company policy and the task. Many companies require disclosure for client-facing work, official documents, or code. For internal drafts and personal productivity, disclosure requirements vary."
  - question: "Is it cheating to use AI for work?"
    answer: "No more than using a calculator is cheating at math. AI is a tool. The key is using it appropriately, disclosing when required, and ensuring quality. The work product is still your responsibility."

AI can make you dramatically more productive at work. It can also get you fired if you use it wrong.

The difference isn't about the AI itself — it's about how you use it. This guide covers the practical rules for using AI tools at work without risking your job, your company's data, or your reputation.

## The Golden Rules

Before diving into specifics, here are the rules that apply everywhere:

1. **Never paste confidential data into free AI tools**
2. **Know your company's AI policy**
3. **Disclose AI use when required**
4. **Always review AI output before using it**
5. **You're responsible for the final product**

Break any of these, and you're taking unnecessary risks.

## Rule 1: Protect Confidential Data

This is the most important rule. Get it wrong, and you could face serious consequences.

### What NOT to Paste Into AI

**Never put these into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI tool:**

- Customer data (names, emails, account info)
- Employee information (salaries, reviews, personal details)
- Financial data (revenue, projections, non-public numbers)
- Source code (proprietary, client, or sensitive)
- Legal documents (contracts, pending litigation)
- Strategic plans (unreleased products, M&A activity)
- Credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Medical/health information (HIPAA concerns)

### Why This Matters

When you paste text into ChatGPT or Claude:
- It's transmitted to their servers
- It may be used to train future models (depending on settings)
- It's stored in logs (at least temporarily)
- You've effectively shared company data with a third party

**Real consequences:**
- Samsung employees leaked source code via ChatGPT (2023)
- Multiple companies banned AI after data leaks
- Employees have been fired for policy violations

### Safe Alternatives

**For sensitive work, use:**

| Option | Privacy Level | Cost |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Enterprise AI (ChatGPT Enterprise, Claude Team/Enterprise) | High | $$$ |
| Microsoft Copilot (with proper licensing) | High | $30/user/mo |
| Local AI (Ollama, LM Studio) | Complete | Free |
| Anonymize data first | Medium | Free |

**Anonymization example:**

Instead of: "Write an email to John Smith at Acme Corp about their $2M contract"

Use: "Write an email to a client about their large contract renewal"

Remove identifying details, get AI help, then add specifics back.

## Rule 2: Know Your Company's AI Policy

Most companies now have AI usage policies. Find yours and read it.

### Common Policy Elements

**Allowed uses:**
- Drafting internal communications
- Research and brainstorming
- Code suggestions (with review)
- Learning and skill development

**Restricted uses:**
- Client-facing content (may require disclosure)
- Final deliverables (human review required)
- Legal or compliance documents
- Anything with confidential data

**Prohibited uses:**
- Sharing proprietary information with AI
- Submitting AI work without review
- Using AI for performance evaluations
- Circumventing security controls

### If There's No Policy

If your company doesn't have an AI policy:

1. Ask your manager directly
2. Check with IT or Legal
3. Default to conservative use
4. Document your usage

Don't assume silence means approval. When in doubt, ask.

### Questions to Ask

- "Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT for work tasks?"
- "Are there specific tools that are approved?"
- "What data can and can't I use with AI?"
- "Do I need to disclose AI assistance?"

---

## Rule 3: Disclose When Required

Transparency about AI use protects you and builds trust.

### When to Disclose

**Always disclose:**
- Client deliverables (proposals, reports, code)
- Legal documents
- Public communications (press releases, blog posts)
- Academic or certification work
- Anything your policy requires

**Usually disclose:**
- Significant portions of work product
- Code you didn't write yourself
- Research summaries

**Generally optional:**
- Brainstorming and ideation
- Grammar and spelling checks
- Internal rough drafts
- Personal productivity use

### How to Disclose

**For documents:**
"This document was drafted with AI assistance and reviewed/edited by [your name]."

**For code:**
```
// Generated with AI assistance, reviewed and modified by [name]
```

**For emails (if required):**
"Note: AI tools were used to help draft this message."

**Verbal:**
"I used Claude to help structure this analysis, then verified the data and refined the conclusions."

### The Benefits of Disclosure

- Protects you if issues arise
- Sets appropriate expectations
- Builds trust with colleagues
- Normalizes responsible AI use

## Rule 4: Always Review AI Output

AI makes mistakes. Confident-sounding mistakes. You're responsible for catching them.

### What to Check

**Accuracy:**
- Are facts correct?
- Are numbers right?
- Are sources real? (AI can hallucinate citations)

**Appropriateness:**
- Is the tone right for the audience?
- Does it match your voice?
- Is anything potentially offensive?

**Completeness:**
- Are all requirements addressed?
- Is anything missing?
- Are there logical gaps?

**Originality:**
- Is it too generic?
- Could this be flagged as AI-generated?
- Does it add real value?

### The Review Process

1. **Read everything** — Don't skim
2. **Verify facts** — Especially numbers and claims
3. **Edit actively** — Don't just accept
4. **Add your expertise** — AI doesn't know your context
5. **Check tone** — Make it sound like you

### Common AI Mistakes

- Hallucinated statistics and sources
- Outdated information
- Generic, corporate-speak language
- Missing context about your specific situation
- Overconfident wrong answers
- Subtle factual errors in technical content

---

## Rule 5: You Own the Output

Whatever AI produces, you're responsible for.

### What This Means

- If AI-generated code has bugs, it's your bug
- If AI-written content has errors, it's your error
- If AI gives bad advice that you follow, it's your decision
- If AI violates copyright, you're liable

### Protecting Yourself

**Before submitting AI-assisted work:**
- Review thoroughly
- Verify key claims
- Edit to add your judgment
- Ensure quality meets standards

**If something goes wrong:**
- Don't blame the AI
- Take responsibility
- Fix the issue
- Learn for next time
