faq:
  - question: "Can AI really plan a trip for someone with dietary restrictions?"
    answer: "Yes! I used Clawd.bot to plan a gluten-free weekend in London. It found dedicated GF restaurants like Ugly Dumpling and suggested celiac-safe options. All three restaurants we visited had proper GF menus and I had zero reactions."
  - question: "Is Clawd.bot free to use for trip planning?"
    answer: "Clawd.bot offers both free and paid tiers. The free version handles basic itineraries well. For a weekend trip with specific requirements like gluten-free dining, it worked perfectly."
  - question: "How accurate are AI-generated travel itineraries?"
    answer: "Pretty accurate for logistics (train times, distances, opening hours), but you'll still deviate. We skipped one breakfast spot and added Chinatown spontaneously. The AI gives you a solid framework — you add the human element."

I've written plenty about [AI trip planning tools](/best-ai-trip-planners/). But there's a difference between testing an app and actually trusting it with your weekend.

So when my girlfriend and I booked last-minute flights to London, I decided to let AI do the heavy lifting. One catch: I have celiac disease, so every restaurant recommendation needed to be genuinely gluten-free safe.

Here's the unfiltered trip report.

## The Setup: Clawd.bot Does the Planning

I gave [Clawd.bot](https://clawd.bot) a simple brief:
- Weekend trip to London (Saturday-Sunday)
- Flying into Stansted
- Want to see MJ The Musical (already had tickets)
- Need 100% gluten-free safe restaurants
- Staying near Notting Hill

Within minutes, I had a detailed itinerary with train times, restaurant recommendations with links to their GF menus, and a Google Maps route connecting everything.

**The AI's Saturday plan:**
- 08:35 — Land at Stansted
- Stansted Express to Liverpool Street (47 min)
- Tube to Notting Hill
- Breakfast at Libby's (dedicated GF bakery)
- Portobello Road Market
- Drop bags at hotel
- 14:30 — MJ The Musical
- Dinner at Ugly Dumpling (GF menu available)

Looked solid on paper. But would it survive contact with reality?

## What Actually Happened

### The First Deviation: Brick Lane Instead of Notting Hill

We landed on time and grabbed the Stansted Express (pro tip: buy tickets in advance — £75 for two people round trip). But at Liverpool Street, we made an audible.

Instead of tubing across London to Notting Hill for breakfast, we walked to Brick Lane. The neighborhood was buzzing, and we found a coffee shop with gluten-free crepes for my girlfriend and a proper Full English for me.

**Lesson #1:** AI gives you a plan. You give it flexibility.

The Notting Hill breakfast spot (Libby's) was probably great. But sometimes the best travel moments come from saying "let's just explore this neighborhood first."

### MJ The Musical: The AI Got This Right

The afternoon was exactly as planned. We dropped our backpacks at the hotel (The Westbourne Hyde Park — chosen by the AI for its location between Notting Hill and the West End), then headed to the Prince Edward Theatre.

MJ The Musical was incredible. The choreography, the live band, the guy playing Michael — absolutely nailed it. We caught it during its "Final Weeks" in London, which made it feel even more special.

The stage design featured Michael Jackson's actual handwritten notes about studying dancers like Bob Fosse and movies like "All That Jazz." A nice touch that set the tone before the curtain even rose.

### The Spontaneous Chinatown Detour

After the show, we weren't ready for dinner yet. The AI's itinerary had us going straight to Ugly Dumpling, but instead we wandered through Soho and stumbled into Chinatown.

The red lanterns were glowing, the streets were packed, and we spent a good 30 minutes just soaking it in. This wasn't on the AI's radar — and that's fine. Good trip planning leaves room for serendipity.

### Dinner at Ugly Dumpling: AI Recommendation = Success

This was the real test. As someone with celiac disease, I can't just "try" a restaurant. One wrong sauce and I'm sick for days.

Clawd.bot had recommended Ugly Dumpling specifically because they have a dedicated gluten-free menu and good reviews on FindMeGlutenFree. The AI even linked to their celiac-safe rating.

**The verdict:** Absolutely legit.

They had:
- A separate GF menu (not just "we can modify things")
- Gluten-free beer options
- Staff who understood cross-contamination

We ordered way too many dumplings, and I had zero reaction. For celiacs reading this: Ugly Dumpling is safe.

### Sunday: British Museum + Fish & Chips

The AI had only planned Saturday in detail, so Sunday was our own creation:

1. **British Museum** (free entry, ~2 hours) — Focused on the Mesopotamia and Ancient Near East galleries. Could easily spend a full day here, but we had a flight to catch.

2. **Wicked Fish at Spitalfields** — Another gluten-free win. Proper fish and chips with GF batter, and massive portions. Perfect pre-flight meal.

Then back to Liverpool Street, Stansted Express, and home.

## The One Thing That Went Wrong

Okay, one small disaster.

I'd pre-booked Stansted Express tickets for both directions. On the return journey, my girlfriend forgot and tapped in with her Google Pay instead of using the ticket.

At Stansted Airport, we tapped out with the pre-booked ticket. Which means somewhere in Greater Anglia's system, there's an incomplete journey on her card.

We're still waiting to see what they charge her.

**Lesson #2:** If you've got pre-booked tickets, remind everyone in your group before they reach the barriers. Contactless muscle memory is real.

## The Verdict: Would I Use AI to Plan Again?

**Absolutely yes.**

Here's what the AI got right:
- Train connections and timings
- Finding genuinely celiac-safe restaurants (not just "GF options available")
- Logical route that minimized backtracking
- Hotel location that made sense for our activities

Here's what required human judgment:
- Deciding to skip Portobello Market (we weren't feeling it)
- Pivoting to Brick Lane for breakfast
- Adding the Chinatown walk
- Planning Sunday ourselves

The AI gave us a framework. We made it our own.

For anyone with dietary restrictions especially — AI trip planners have gotten remarkably good at finding safe options. Clawd.bot didn't just search for "gluten-free London." It found places with dedicated menus, celiac reviews, and proper food safety practices.

Three restaurants. Zero reactions. That's a win.
