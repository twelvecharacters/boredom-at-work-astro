Just when we thought we'd settled into Sequoia, Apple dropped its most radical visual overhaul in years: **macOS 26 Tahoe**.

Named after the serene alpine lake, Tahoe brings a design language Apple calls **"Liquid Glass."** It's airy, translucent, and looks like it was plucked straight out of a sci-fi movie. But beyond the eye candy, there are serious productivity features and hidden tricks worth knowing.

Here are 25 tips and hidden features to master macOS Tahoe.

---

## The Liquid Glass Visual Overhaul

### 1. Understand What Changed

Liquid Glass isn't just a coat of paint. The entire interface now uses:

- **Translucent materials** — Windows show hints of what's behind them
- **Dynamic reflections** — UI elements reflect light based on your wallpaper
- **Depth layers** — Active windows feel "closer" to you
- **Continuous curves** — Rounded corners everywhere, inspired by visionOS

The effect is stunning on Retina displays, but can be distracting if you're not used to it.

### 2. Reduce Transparency (If It's Too Much)

Not everyone loves the glass effect. If you find it distracting or your Mac feels sluggish:

**System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Reduce Transparency**

This makes windows more solid and opaque. It also improves performance on older Macs by reducing GPU load.

### 3. Customize the Accent Color

Tahoe's Liquid Glass reflects your accent color more prominently than before:

**System Settings > Appearance > Accent Color**

Try different colors with your wallpaper — some combinations look stunning with the new transparency effects.

### 4. Use Dark Mode with Liquid Glass

The Liquid Glass effect looks completely different in Dark Mode. The translucency shows darker, moodier backgrounds through the windows. 

**System Settings > Appearance > Dark**

Or use **Auto** to switch based on time of day.

### 5. Change Your Wallpaper Strategically

Your wallpaper now affects the entire look of the OS. Liquid Glass tints windows based on the colors behind them.

- **Solid colors** — Clean, consistent window tints
- **Gradients** — Windows change tint as you move them
- **Dynamic wallpapers** — The whole OS shifts throughout the day

## LLM Siri: The New AI-Powered Assistant

### 6. Enable Apple Intelligence

The new LLM-powered Siri requires Apple Intelligence to be enabled:

**System Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > Apple Intelligence**

This requires an Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or later) and will gradually enable new features as they roll out in 2026.

### 7. Use Natural Language with Siri

The new Siri actually understands context. Try complex requests:

- "Find that PDF about marketing from last week and email it to Sarah"
- "What did John say in yesterday's meeting notes?"
- "Remind me about this email tomorrow morning"

Siri can now reference files, emails, and conversations — not just web searches.

### 8. Type to Siri (The Better Way)

Don't want to talk to your computer in the office? The new Type to Siri interface is much better:

**Press and hold Command key** (or change in System Settings)

A sleek glass bar appears at the bottom of the screen. Type your request and press Enter. No more awkward voice commands at your desk.

### 9. Use Siri for Summarization

Select any text, right-click, and choose **Summarize with Siri**. Or ask:

- "Summarize my unread emails"
- "What's important in this document?"
- "Give me the key points from this webpage"

### 10. Siri + Shortcuts Integration

Siri now works much better with Shortcuts. You can create complex automations and trigger them with natural language:

"Run my morning routine" → Opens apps, plays music, shows calendar, etc.

## The New Phone App

### 11. Manage Calls from Your Mac

Tahoe introduces a dedicated **Phone app** (finally). No more digging for your iPhone when a call comes in.

Features:
- View and manage voicemail
- See recent call history
- Make FaceTime Audio and regular calls
- Send calls to voicemail with a tap

### 12. Visual Voicemail on Mac

The Phone app includes visual voicemail. Play, delete, or transcribe voicemails directly on your Mac without touching your iPhone.

### 13. Quick Reply to Missed Calls

When you miss a call, you can send a quick text reply directly from the notification without opening any app.

## iPhone Mirroring 2.0

### 14. Bi-Directional Drag and Drop

iPhone Mirroring got a major upgrade. You can now drag files **both ways**:

- Drag a photo from your Mac to an iPhone app
- Drag a file from your iPhone to your Mac desktop
- Works with almost any app on either device

### 15. Control iPhone with Keyboard

While mirroring, your Mac keyboard works in iPhone apps:
- Type in iPhone text fields
- Use keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+C, Cmd+V work)
- Arrow keys navigate some interfaces

### 16. Wireless iPhone Mirroring

Tahoe's mirroring now works over WiFi (not just when plugged in). Your iPhone just needs to be on the same network.

## Productivity Features

### 17. Window Tiling Gets Smart

Tahoe improves window tiling with AI-suggested layouts:

- Drag a window to the edge → See suggested layouts
- System remembers your preferences per app
- Works better with ultrawide monitors

Keyboard shortcuts:
- **Fn + Control + ←/→** — Tile left/right
- **Fn + Control + ↑** — Maximize
- **Fn + Control + ↓** — Return to original size

### 18. Focus Modes with Screen Layouts

Focus modes can now save and restore **window arrangements**:

**System Settings > Focus > [Your Focus] > Screen Layout**

When you activate "Work" focus, your windows automatically arrange themselves. When you switch to "Personal," different apps and layouts appear.

### 19. Better Stage Manager

Stage Manager is actually usable in Tahoe:

- Less aggressive window grouping
- Works better with multiple monitors
- Quick switch between window sets with keyboard

Toggle: **Control Center > Stage Manager** or **Fn + F**

### 20. Finder Quick Actions Expanded

Right-click any file for new AI-powered Quick Actions:
- **Summarize** — Get a summary of document contents
- **Transcribe** — Convert audio/video to text
- **Remove Background** — One-click for images
- **Translate** — Translate document contents

## Performance & System

### 21. Background App Management

Tahoe is more aggressive about managing background apps:

- Unused apps are suspended faster
- Less RAM used by background processes
- Better battery life on MacBooks

You can see what's suspended in **Activity Monitor > CPU > (sort by Energy Impact)**.

### 22. Optimized Charging Gets Smarter

For MacBooks, optimized charging now learns from **multiple locations**:

- Knows to charge fully before your commute
- Adapts to changing schedules
- Works even if you don't have a consistent routine

Check status in **System Settings > Battery > Battery Health**.

### 23. Memory Pressure Improvements

Tahoe manages memory better, especially on 8GB Macs:

- More aggressive memory compression
- Better swap file management
- Apps resume faster from suspension

If you have an 8GB Mac that felt cramped in Sequoia, Tahoe may feel smoother.

## Hidden Features & Easter Eggs

### 24. The Tahoe Screensaver

A gorgeous new screensaver shows aerial footage of Lake Tahoe with the Liquid Glass aesthetic:

**System Settings > Screen Saver > Tahoe**

It dynamically adjusts based on time of day and matches the new design language beautifully.

### 25. Terminal Gets a Glass Makeover

Even Terminal embraces Liquid Glass:

- New translucent background
- Updated default color schemes
- Better font rendering

To customize: **Terminal > Settings > Profiles** — try the new "Liquid" profile.

## Performance Tips for Tahoe

### If Your Mac Feels Slow

1. **Reduce Transparency** (Settings > Accessibility > Display)
2. **Reduce Motion** (same location)
3. **Close unused apps** (Tahoe is better at this, but still helps)
4. **Check Activity Monitor** for runaway processes
5. **Restart** — Tahoe has some memory leaks in early builds

### For Best Battery Life

1. **Use Safari** (still more efficient than Chrome)
2. **Enable Low Power Mode** (menu bar battery icon)
3. **Let background apps suspend** (don't force-quit everything)
4. **Use Focus modes** to limit notifications

---

## The Bottom Line

macOS Tahoe is Apple's most significant visual update since Big Sur, and the AI features through Apple Intelligence are genuinely useful. The Liquid Glass design takes some getting used to, but it's gorgeous once you adapt.

**Worth upgrading?** Yes, especially on Apple Silicon Macs. Intel users should update for security but won't get the full experience.

**Best new features:**
1. LLM Siri that actually understands context
2. The Phone app (finally!)
3. iPhone Mirroring improvements
4. Focus modes with screen layouts

Take a weekend to explore. There's a lot here, and the hidden features are worth discovering.
