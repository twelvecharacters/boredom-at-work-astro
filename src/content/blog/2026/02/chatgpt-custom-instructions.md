faq:
  - question: "What are ChatGPT custom instructions?"
    answer: "Custom instructions are persistent settings that tell ChatGPT about you and your preferences. Combined with a personality preset, they apply to all conversations (including existing ones) automatically, so you don't have to repeat context like your job, expertise level, or preferred response format."
  - question: "Are custom instructions available on ChatGPT free?"
    answer: "Yes, custom instructions are available on all ChatGPT tiers — Free, Go ($8/month), Plus ($20/month), and Pro ($200/month). It's one of the most valuable free features that many users don't know about."
  - question: "Can I have different custom instructions for different tasks?"
    answer: "Not directly, but you can use Custom GPTs (Plus) for different contexts, or manually update your instructions when switching between work modes. Some users keep a notes file with different instruction sets to copy-paste."

Most people use ChatGPT like a stranger — starting every conversation from zero. But there's a better way.

Custom Instructions let you tell ChatGPT who you are and how you want it to respond. Set them once, and every conversation automatically gets better.

Here's how to set them up properly.

## What Are Custom Instructions?

Custom Instructions are part of ChatGPT's **Personalization** settings. The system has two layers:

1. **Personality preset** — A "Base style and tone" dropdown that lets you choose from presets like Default, Professional, Friendly, Candid, Quirky, Efficient, Nerdy, and Cynical. This sets the overall vibe of ChatGPT's responses.

2. **Custom Instructions field** — A text field where you can write anything you want ChatGPT to always keep in mind: your background, job, expertise level, response format preferences, tone, length, and style guidelines. You get ~1,500 characters to work with.

These settings persist across **all** your ChatGPT conversations — including existing ones. Think of it as a permanent system prompt that shapes every interaction.

## Why Custom Instructions Matter

### Without Custom Instructions:
Every conversation starts cold. You constantly repeat:
- "I'm a marketing manager"
- "Keep it concise"
- "Don't be overly formal"
- "I need practical examples"

### With Custom Instructions:
ChatGPT already knows this. Every response is tailored to you from the first message.

**Real impact:**
- Fewer back-and-forth corrections
- Responses match your expertise level
- Consistent tone and format
- Less frustration, better results

## How to Set Up Custom Instructions

### Step 1: Open Settings

**On Desktop:**
1. Click your profile icon (bottom-right of the sidebar)
2. Click "Settings"
3. Select "Personalization"
4. Click "Custom instructions"

**On Mobile:**
1. Tap your profile icon
2. Tap "Settings"
3. Tap "Personalization"
4. Tap "Custom instructions"

### Step 2: Choose a Personality Preset

Use the **"Base style and tone"** dropdown to pick a personality (Default, Professional, Friendly, Candid, Quirky, Efficient, Nerdy, or Cynical). This sets the general tone for all responses.

### Step 3: Write Your Custom Instructions

Below the personality dropdown, you'll see the custom instructions field (~1,500 characters). This is where you add specific details about yourself, your preferences, and how you want responses formatted.

### Step 4: Enable the Toggle

Make sure **"Enable customization"** is turned on.

That's it. Your settings apply immediately to **all** conversations — including ones you've already started.

## Part 1: What to Tell ChatGPT About You

The first part of your custom instructions should set context. Include:

### Your Professional Role
```
I'm a product manager at a B2B SaaS company. I work with 
engineering teams and stakeholders to ship features.
```

### Your Expertise Level
```
I'm experienced with project management but new to data 
analysis. I know basic Excel but not Python.
```

### Your Industry/Domain
```
I work in healthcare tech. I need to consider HIPAA 
compliance and patient privacy in my work.
```

### Your Goals
```
I'm learning AI tools to improve my productivity and 
eventually transition into a product-AI role.
```

### Relevant Constraints
```
I work in a corporate environment with strict IT policies. 
I can't install random software or use unapproved tools.
```

### Example: Complete "About You" Section

```
I'm a marketing manager at a mid-size e-commerce company. 
I handle content strategy, email campaigns, and social media.

Experience level:
- Expert: Email marketing, content writing, social media
- Intermediate: SEO, analytics, A/B testing
- Beginner: Paid ads, video production, AI tools

I work with a small team (2 people) and limited budget. 
I need practical, actionable advice — not enterprise solutions.

I'm based in Germany but create content in English for a 
global audience. I prefer American English spelling.
```

## Part 2: How You Want Responses

The second part of your custom instructions should control output format and style. Be specific:

### Tone Preferences
```
Be direct and conversational. Skip the corporate fluff. 
It's okay to be casual but stay professional.
```

### Format Preferences
```
Use bullet points for lists. Keep paragraphs short (2-3 
sentences max). Use headers to organize longer responses.
```

### Length Preferences
```
Be concise. Start with the answer, then explain if needed. 
I'll ask for more detail if I want it.
```

### What to Include/Exclude
```
Always include practical examples. Skip obvious caveats 
like "it depends on your situation" — I know that.
```

### Technical Preferences
```
When giving code, include comments explaining what each 
part does. Prefer modern syntax and best practices.
```

### What to Avoid
```
Don't start responses with "Great question!" or "I'd be 
happy to help!" Just answer directly.
```

### Example: Complete "Response Style" Section

```
Response format:
- Lead with the answer or recommendation
- Use bullet points for lists (not numbered unless order matters)
- Keep explanations concise — I'll ask if I need more
- Include one practical example when relevant

Tone:
- Direct and conversational
- No corporate speak or filler phrases
- Don't start with "Great question!" or "Certainly!"
- It's fine to say "I don't know" or "This might not work"

When I ask for help with writing:
- Match my existing tone if I provide samples
- Give me options when there's no clear best choice
- Point out if my approach has issues

When I ask about tools/products:
- Include pricing if relevant
- Mention notable alternatives
- Be honest about limitations

Skip the disclaimers unless truly important for safety/legal.
```

## Advanced Tips

### 1. Iterate on Your Instructions

Your first version won't be perfect. After a week:
- Note when ChatGPT misses the mark
- Update instructions to prevent those issues
- Remove instructions that don't seem to matter

### 2. Use Specific Anti-Patterns

If ChatGPT keeps doing something annoying, explicitly forbid it:

```
Don't:
- Start with "Certainly!" or "Of course!"
- Add unnecessary caveats to every response
- Suggest "consulting a professional" for basic questions
- Repeat my question back to me
```

### 3. Set Conditional Instructions

```
When I ask about [topic], always include [specific element].
When I share code, check for [common issues].
When I seem frustrated, be more concise.
```

### 4. Include Format Templates

```
For meeting summaries, use this format:
## Key Decisions
## Action Items (with owners)
## Open Questions
## Next Steps
```

### 5. Specify Default Assumptions

```
Unless I say otherwise, assume:
- Budget is limited
- Timeline is tight
- I need the simplest solution that works
- I'll handle edge cases later
```

## What NOT to Put in Custom Instructions

### Don't Include:
- **Sensitive personal info** (full name, address, financial details)
- **Passwords or API keys** (obviously)
- **Information that changes frequently** (current project details)
- **Very long instructions** (keep it focused)
- **Contradictory rules** (confuses the model)

### Keep Separate:
- Project-specific context → put in individual chats
- Temporary preferences → mention in the conversation
- Confidential work details → be careful what you share

---

## Custom Instructions vs Custom GPTs

Both personalize ChatGPT, but differently:

| Feature | Custom Instructions | Custom GPTs |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Applies to | All chats (including existing) | Specific GPT only |
| Setup | Personality dropdown + text field | Full builder |
| Switchable | One active set | Many GPTs available |
| Knowledge upload | ❌ | ✅ |
| Actions/APIs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Shareable | ❌ | ✅ |
| Available on Free | ✅ | Use only (not create) |

**Use Custom Instructions for:** Your default preferences that apply everywhere.

**Use Custom GPTs for:** Specific workflows, specialized tasks, or when you need uploaded knowledge.

They work together — Custom GPTs can have their own instructions ON TOP of your custom instructions.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ChatGPT ignores my instructions"

- Instructions might be too long — prioritize the most important
- Conflicting instructions confuse the model
- Some instructions only work for certain types of requests
- Try being more explicit and specific

### "Responses are too different from before"

- Custom Instructions change the baseline behavior
- If you preferred something about the old responses, add it to instructions
- You can always say "ignore my custom instructions for this" in a chat

### "I want different instructions for different tasks"

Options:
1. Use Custom GPTs for different contexts (Plus)
2. Keep a notes doc with instruction sets to swap in
3. Prefix specific chats with "For this conversation, also consider: [context]"

### "I hit the character limit"

The custom instructions field caps at ~1,500 characters. To make the most of it:
- Prioritize: what causes the most repeated corrections?
- Let the personality preset handle tone — save your character budget for specifics
- Use shorthand and abbreviations
- Remove instructions that don't noticeably improve responses
- Move less critical preferences to Custom GPTs

## My Personal Setup (Example)

Here's what I actually use:

**Personality preset:** Candid (direct and straightforward)

**Custom Instructions:**
```
Tech writer creating content for professionals learning AI tools.
Expert in: productivity software, AI assistants, writing
Intermediate: coding (Python, JS), data analysis
Based in Europe, writing in American English.
I value clarity over cleverness.

Format: short paragraphs, bullet points, headers for longer responses,
code blocks with syntax highlighting.

When I ask about tools: mention pricing, alternatives, honest limitations.
When I ask for writing help: give options, not just one answer.
When I share drafts: substantive feedback first, then nitpicks.

Don't hedge everything. If you're unsure, say so directly.
```

---

## Start Now: Quick Setup

Don't overthink it. Start with this minimal setup:

1. **Pick a personality preset** — "Professional" or "Efficient" are safe defaults for work
2. **Add minimal custom instructions:**

```
I'm a [your job] who needs [main use case for ChatGPT].
My expertise level: [beginner/intermediate/advanced] in relevant areas.

Be concise and direct. Use bullet points.
Skip phrases like "Great question!" — just answer.
Include examples when helpful.
```

You can always refine later. The best custom instructions are the ones you actually set up.
