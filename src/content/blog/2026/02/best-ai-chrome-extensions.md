faq:
  - question: "Are AI Chrome extensions safe to use?"
    answer: "Reputable extensions from known companies are generally safe. However, be cautious: extensions can read your browsing data. Check reviews, verify the developer, and avoid extensions requesting excessive permissions. Never use unknown extensions for sensitive work."
  - question: "Do AI Chrome extensions slow down my browser?"
    answer: "Most well-built extensions have minimal impact. However, running multiple AI extensions simultaneously can affect performance. If you notice slowdowns, disable extensions you're not actively using."
  - question: "Can my employer see which Chrome extensions I use?"
    answer: "If you're on a managed work computer, your IT department can likely see installed extensions. Many companies have policies about approved extensions. When in doubt, check with IT before installing AI tools on work devices."

## The Bottom Line

AI Chrome extensions bring AI assistance into your existing workflow without friction. Instead of switching to ChatGPT or Claude, you get AI help right where you're working.

**Start with Sider** — It's the most capable and flexible option.

**Add Grammarly** — Passive writing help with zero effort.

**Add Perplexity** — When you need to research or fact-check.

Beyond that, install based on specific needs. More extensions isn't better — a few well-chosen tools beat a cluttered browser.

The goal isn't to AI-ify everything. It's to remove friction from tasks that benefit from AI assistance, so you can focus on work that requires your human judgment.
