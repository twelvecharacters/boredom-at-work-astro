faq:
  - question: "Are AI meeting assistants safe for confidential meetings?"
    answer: "Most cloud-based tools (Otter, Fireflies) process audio on their servers. For sensitive meetings, consider Granola (local processing) or disable the assistant entirely. Always check your company's policy on recording meetings."
  - question: "Do participants know they're being recorded?"
    answer: "Most tools announce themselves when joining or display a recording indicator. Many jurisdictions require consent from all participants. Always inform attendees that you're using an AI assistant."
  - question: "Can AI meeting assistants work with in-person meetings?"
    answer: "Yes, most have mobile apps that can transcribe in-person meetings using your phone's microphone. Quality depends on room acoustics and speaker distance from the device."

You're in a meeting, trying to pay attention while frantically typing notes. You miss half of what's said because you're too busy writing down the other half.

AI meeting assistants fix this. They join your calls, transcribe everything, and give you summaries with action items — so you can actually focus on the conversation.

After testing every major option, here's what actually works.

## The Quick Comparison

| Tool | Best For | Price | Key Strength |
|------|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Otter.ai** | General use | Free/$16/mo | Best transcription accuracy |
| **Fireflies.ai** | Sales teams | Free/$18/mo | CRM integrations |
| **Granola** | Privacy-focused | Free/$10/mo | Local processing |
| **Fathom** | Free option | Free/$24/mo | Generous free tier |
| **tl;dv** | Video clips | Free/$20/mo | Shareable highlights |
| **Tactiq** | Google Meet | Free/$12/mo | Chrome extension |

## How AI Meeting Assistants Work

1. **They join your call** — As a bot participant or browser extension
2. **Record and transcribe** — Real-time speech-to-text
3. **Identify speakers** — Who said what
4. **Generate summaries** — Key points, decisions, action items
5. **Make it searchable** — Find anything discussed in past meetings

The magic is in the summaries. Instead of scrolling through an hour of transcript, you get a 2-minute summary with the important stuff.

**Offline Capable**
Works without internet connection. Sync later if needed.

### Limitations

## Tips for Using AI Meeting Assistants

### 1. Inform Participants
Always let attendees know you're using an AI assistant. Many jurisdictions require consent for recording.

### 2. Review Before Sharing
AI summaries can miss nuance or misattribute quotes. Always review before forwarding to others.

### 3. Don't Over-Rely
AI can miss context, sarcasm, and non-verbal communication. The summary is a starting point, not gospel.

### 4. Use for Async Updates
Send meeting summaries to stakeholders who couldn't attend instead of scheduling another meeting.

### 5. Search Your History
Most tools let you search across all past meetings. Use this to find "what did we decide about X?"

### 6. Set Up Topic Alerts
Configure the tool to highlight when specific topics (budget, timeline, competitors) are mentioned.

## Privacy and Security Considerations

### Cloud vs. Local

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Cloud (Otter, Fireflies) | Better accuracy, more features | Data leaves your device |
| Local (Granola) | Data stays private | Less accurate, fewer features |

### Before Using at Work

1. **Check company policy** — Many organizations have rules about recording
2. **Verify compliance** — SOC 2, GDPR compliance matters for enterprise
3. **Understand data retention** — How long are recordings stored?
4. **Know who has access** — Can vendor employees access your transcripts?

### Legal Requirements

- **One-party consent states (US):** You can record if you're a participant
- **Two-party consent states (US):** All participants must consent
- **GDPR (EU):** Explicit consent required
- **Always safer:** Inform everyone before recording

---

## The Bottom Line

AI meeting assistants have genuinely changed how I work. I can focus on conversations instead of frantically typing notes. I can catch up on meetings I missed in 2 minutes instead of 30. I can search my meeting history like email.

**Start here:**
- Try Fathom if you want free
- Try Otter if you want the best quality
- Try Granola if privacy matters most

The technology is mature enough that any of these options will save you time. Pick one, use it for a month, and you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
