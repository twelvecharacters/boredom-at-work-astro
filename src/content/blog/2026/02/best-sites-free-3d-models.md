faq:
  - question: "What is an STL file?"
    answer: "STL (Standard Tessellation Language) is the most common file format for 3D printing. It contains the 3D geometry of a model as a mesh of triangles. Your slicer software (like Cura) converts STL files into instructions your printer can understand."
  - question: "Are free 3D models really free to print and sell?"
    answer: "Not always. Each model has a license. 'Personal use only' means you can print for yourself but not sell. 'Creative Commons' licenses vary—some allow commercial use, others don't. Always check the license before selling prints."
  - question: "Which site has the most free 3D models?"
    answer: "Thingiverse has the largest collection with over 2 million models. However, quantity doesn't mean quality—Printables and Thangs often have better-curated, more reliable models."
  - question: "Why do some STL files fail to print?"
    answer: "Common reasons: the model wasn't designed for 3D printing (bad geometry), it needs supports you didn't add, or it's too detailed for your printer's resolution. Look for models marked as 'tested' or 'print-ready' and check the comments for print settings."
  - question: "Can I modify free 3D models?"
    answer: "Depends on the license. Most Creative Commons licenses allow modifications for personal use. If you want to sell modified versions, look for models with 'CC BY' or 'CC0' licenses. Some sites like Thangs let you remix models directly in the browser."
  - question: "What's the difference between STL and 3MF files?"
    answer: "3MF is a newer format that includes more information—colors, materials, print settings, and proper units. STL only contains geometry. If a model offers both, 3MF is usually better. Most slicers support both formats."
tldr: "Start with Printables (best quality) and Thingiverse (largest selection). Use Thangs to search across all sites at once. For specific niches: MyMiniFactory for tabletop gaming, Cults3D for artistic designs, NASA for space stuff. Always check licenses before selling prints."

---

### 12. Free3D (free3d.com)

**Best for:** Models for rendering (not all are printable)

Free3D has lots of models, but many are designed for rendering/animation, not 3D printing. Filter for "printable" models.

**What you'll find:**
- Characters and figures
- Vehicles
- Architecture
- Props

**License:** Varies—many are personal use only

**Verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐ Hit or miss for printing

---

## Understanding Licenses

Before you print (especially if you plan to sell), understand these common licenses:

| License | Personal Use | Modifications | Commercial/Sell |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **CC0 (Public Domain)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **CC BY (Attribution)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (credit creator) |
| **CC BY-SA (ShareAlike)** | ✅ | ✅ (same license) | ✅ (credit + same license) |
| **CC BY-NC (NonCommercial)** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **CC BY-NC-SA** | ✅ | ✅ (same license) | ❌ |
| **Personal Use Only** | ✅ | Maybe | ❌ |

**Rule of thumb:** If you want to sell prints, look for CC0, CC BY, or models explicitly marked "commercial use allowed."

## Tips for Finding Good Models

### 1. Check the "Makes" or "Prints" Section

Real photos from people who printed the model tell you:
- Does it actually print successfully?
- What settings did they use?
- How does it look in real life?

Avoid models with zero makes—they might be untested.

### 2. Read the Comments

The comments often contain:
- Print settings that work
- Warnings about problems
- Requests for modifications (that might be uploaded)
- Tips for supports and orientation

### 3. Look for Print Settings

Good model uploads include:
- Recommended layer height
- Infill percentage
- Support requirements
- Material suggestions
- Print orientation

### 4. Check File Formats

- **STL:** Universal, works everywhere
- **3MF:** Better than STL (includes settings), use if available
- **OBJ:** Works but less common for printing
- **STEP/IGES:** CAD files, can modify but need CAD software

### 5. Sort by "Popular" or "Most Makes"

Popular models are popular for a reason—they work.

## My Workflow for Finding Models

1. **Start with Thangs** — Search across all sites
2. **Check Printables first** — Best quality, most reliable
3. **Fall back to Thingiverse** — Largest selection if I can't find it
4. **Read comments/makes** — Verify it actually prints
5. **Download 3MF if available** — Better than STL
6. **Check license** — Especially if I might sell later

---

## What to Print First?

If you're new, start with:

- **Cable organizers** — Useful, easy to print
- **Phone stands** — Practical, quick prints
- **Desk accessories** — Pencil holders, headphone hooks
- **Calibration tests** — Benchies, cubes, temp towers

Graduate to:
- **Articulated models** — Print-in-place dragons, octopi
- **Functional tools** — Wrenches, clamps, jigs
- **Cosplay props** — Helmets, weapons, armor pieces

---
