faq:
  - question: "Is Polymarket legal in the US?"
    answer: "Yes, as of late 2025 Polymarket is federally legal in the US after acquiring QCX, a CFTC-licensed exchange. However, access is still rolling out through a waitlist system, and some states like Nevada have challenged its operations. The global (crypto-based) version remains off-limits to US residents for real-money trading."
  - question: "What is the difference between Polymarket and Kalshi?"
    answer: "Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated exchange that accepts USD deposits via bank transfer and targets US users. Polymarket's global platform runs on crypto (USDC on Polygon) and offers deeper international markets. Polymarket US is a newer regulated entity with extremely low fees but limited access. Kalshi is easier to start with if you're in the US."
  - question: "Do you have to pay taxes on prediction market winnings?"
    answer: "Yes, prediction market profits are taxable in the US. Kalshi issues 1099 forms for users who meet IRS thresholds. Polymarket's global platform uses crypto, so you may need to track gains yourself. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation — tax treatment of event contracts is still evolving."

You're staring at your screen between tasks, half-reading the news, and you see a headline: "Fed Expected to Hold Rates." And you think — well, *I* could have called that two weeks ago.

That's basically the pitch for prediction markets. Instead of just having opinions about what's going to happen in the world, you can put money on them. Will the Fed cut rates? Who wins the next election? Will Bitcoin hit $150K this year?

Two platforms dominate this space in 2026: **Polymarket** and **Kalshi**. Both let you trade on real-world events. But they work very differently under the hood — different technology, different regulation, different fee structures, and different audiences.

I spent time on both platforms to see how they actually compare. Here's what I found.

## What Are Prediction Markets?

If you're new to this, here's the quick version.

A prediction market is an exchange where you buy and sell contracts based on the outcome of real-world events. Each contract pays out $1.00 if the event happens and $0.00 if it doesn't. The current trading price represents the market's implied probability.

Say you see a contract: **"Will the Fed cut rates in June 2026?"** trading at $0.65. That means the market thinks there's roughly a 65% chance it happens. If you think the probability is higher, you buy. If you think it's lower, you sell. When the event resolves, you either get $1.00 per contract or $0.00.

It's not gambling in the traditional sense — prediction markets have been shown to aggregate information more efficiently than polls, pundits, or models. The 2024 US presidential election was a landmark moment: Polymarket processed over $3.3 billion in volume on the presidential race alone, and its odds turned out to be significantly more accurate than most traditional polls.

That election cycle put prediction markets on the map for mainstream audiences. And now in 2026, both Polymarket and Kalshi are competing aggressively for your attention (and your money).

## Polymarket: The Crypto-Native Pioneer

### How It Works

Polymarket was founded in 2020 by Shayne Coplan and quickly became the go-to prediction market for crypto-savvy traders. The global platform runs on the Polygon blockchain, and all trading is settled in USDC — a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.

You interact with an order book (technically a CLOB — Central Limit Order Book) where you can place limit orders, market orders, or post-only orders that add liquidity. When you win, your contracts settle at $1.00 each and the USDC lands in your wallet.

### Funding Your Account

This is where Polymarket's crypto roots show. On the global platform, you need USDC on the Polygon network. You can get there several ways:

- **Crypto transfer** from Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance (send USDC via Polygon)
- **Buy directly** with a debit/credit card through MoonPay or Stripe
- **Apple Pay / Google Pay** for quick mobile funding
- **Robinhood Connect** — a newer integration that lets you pull from your Robinhood balance

Deposits typically confirm in 1-5 minutes on Polygon, which is fast compared to traditional banking rails. But if you've never touched crypto, the initial setup has a learning curve.

### The US Situation

Polymarket has a complicated history with the US. In January 2022, the CFTC fined Polymarket $1.4 million for operating an unregistered trading facility, and US residents were banned from the platform.

Fast-forward to late 2025: Polymarket acquired QCX, a CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse, for $112 million. This gave them a Designated Contract Market (DCM) designation, allowing them to legally offer event contracts to American users.

**Polymarket US** launched in January 2026 with an iOS app, starting with sports markets. But here's the catch — access is still gated behind an invite-only waitlist as of early 2026. The rollout has been slower than expected, with some reporting calling it a "fumbled launch." Trading volume on the US app has already topped $450 million in its first full month, but it's still far from the open-access experience of the global platform.

If you're in the US right now, you *might* be able to get in. But it's not guaranteed.

### Fees

Polymarket's fee structure is one of its biggest selling points:

- **Global platform:** Most markets have zero trading fees. Certain crypto markets charge taker fees on a variable curve (capped at ~3% at 50/50 odds), while maker orders are always free. On winning trades, Polymarket takes 2% of net profits.
- **US platform:** A flat 0.10% taker fee (10 basis points). So a $1,000 position costs you $1.00 in fees. Maker orders are free. No deposit or withdrawal fees.

The fees collected from takers are redistributed daily to market makers as rebates, which helps keep spreads tight.

### Markets Available

Polymarket shines in **politics, crypto, and international events**. During election season it's unmatched — the 2024 cycle proved that. You'll also find:

- Federal Reserve decisions and economic indicators
- Tech events (product launches, regulatory actions)
- Entertainment and culture
- International sports (Premier League, cricket)
- Crypto price targets and milestones

The global platform has the widest variety. The US version is still expanding beyond its initial sports focus.

### Strengths

- **Lowest fees in the industry** (especially the US platform at 0.10%)
- **Deepest liquidity on political markets** — no one else comes close
- **Fast settlement** via Polygon blockchain
- **Maker rebate program** rewards liquidity providers
- **Global market coverage** that Kalshi can't match

### Weaknesses

- **US access is still limited** through a waitlist
- **Crypto learning curve** on the global platform
- **State-level legal challenges** (Nevada filed a complaint in January 2026)
- **No native Android app** for the US platform yet
- **Customer support** has been a pain point for some users

## Kalshi: The Regulated US Contender

### How It Works

Kalshi launched in 2021 as the first CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange in the US. Founded by Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara (both MIT grads), it was built from day one to work within the US regulatory framework.

Every contract on Kalshi is a regulated financial derivative. You trade in dollars, fund your account through traditional banking, and your funds are held in a segregated US bank account. It feels more like using a brokerage than a crypto exchange.

The mechanics are similar — buy contracts at a price between $0.01 and $0.99, and they resolve at $1.00 or $0.00. But the experience of getting started is dramatically simpler if you're a US resident.

### Funding Your Account

This is Kalshi's strongest advantage for US users:

- **ACH bank transfer** — free, connects to any US bank account
- **Wire transfer** — free, for larger amounts
- **Debit card** — 2% processing fee
- **Crypto deposits** via third-party providers (newer option)

The minimum deposit is effectively $1, though some sources report $10 to start trading. Either way, you can be up and running in minutes with a bank transfer.

### Regulation

Kalshi operates as a CFTC-designated contract market (DCM) under the Commodity Exchange Act. This means:

- Customer funds are held in **segregated accounts** at US banks
- Kalshi follows strict **capital requirements** and reporting obligations
- Contracts are treated as **regulated financial derivatives**
- The platform issues **1099 tax forms** for users who meet IRS thresholds

Kalshi is available in 42+ US states. Some states with strict gaming regulations (like Nevada) have limited access to certain market types, particularly sports-related contracts.

After a $1 billion funding round in November 2025, Kalshi hit an $11 billion valuation — making it one of the fastest-growing fintech companies in the country.

### Fees

Kalshi's fees are more complex than Polymarket's. They use a probability-weighted formula:

- **Taker fee:** `0.07 x contracts x price x (1 - price)` — meaning fees are highest at 50/50 odds (~1.75 cents per contract) and lowest at extreme probabilities
- **Maker fee:** `0.0175 x contracts x price x (1 - price)` — about 25% of the taker rate
- **No fees** when your contract settles (wins or loses)
- **Withdrawal:** $2 per withdrawal to your bank account
- **Deposit:** Free for ACH/wire, 2% for debit cards

In practice, a $100 position on a 50/50 market costs roughly $1.20 in fees. That's notably higher than Polymarket US (which would charge $0.10 for the same trade), but it includes the benefit of full regulatory protection and US banking infrastructure.

### Markets Available

Kalshi has aggressively expanded its market selection:

- **Sports:** NFL, NBA, MLB, college football, golf, MMA, tennis, and more — this is now their biggest volume driver
- **Politics:** Elections, policy decisions, government actions
- **Economics:** Fed rate decisions, inflation, recession probability
- **Crypto:** 50+ crypto-specific markets covering Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major assets
- **Weather:** Temperature records, hurricane landfalls
- **Culture:** Oscar winners, award shows

Sports contracts are Kalshi's growth engine. In 2025, Kalshi cleared $43.1 billion in total volume, with over 90% tied to sports. A partnership with the fantasy sports app Sleeper, announced in early 2026, is bringing Kalshi's event contracts to Sleeper's 10 million users.

### Strengths

- **Fully regulated** — CFTC-designated, segregated accounts, tax forms
- **Easy to start** — bank transfer, no crypto knowledge needed
- **Native mobile apps** for both iOS and Android
- **Deepest US sports liquidity** — especially NFL, NBA
- **Customer support infrastructure** — proper help center and ticketing
- **Institutional backing** — $11 billion valuation, partnerships with Robinhood and Sleeper

### Weaknesses

- **Higher fees** than Polymarket, especially on 50/50 markets
- **$2 withdrawal fee** adds up for frequent traders
- **Weaker political market liquidity** compared to Polymarket
- **US-only** — not available to international users
- **Limited international event coverage**

## Head-to-Head: How They Actually Compare

### Fees

**Winner: Polymarket**

This isn't close. Polymarket US charges 0.10% per taker trade with free maker orders. Kalshi's variable formula means you're paying roughly 10-15x more on the same trade, depending on the contract price.

On the global Polymarket platform, most markets are completely fee-free (you only pay 2% on net profits when you win). Kalshi can't compete with that.

That said, Kalshi's fees include the overhead of US regulatory compliance, FDIC-eligible banking partners, and traditional customer support. You're paying for infrastructure.

### Market Selection

**Winner: Depends on what you trade**

If you're into **US sports**, Kalshi wins. Their volume, liquidity, and market variety in NFL, NBA, and college sports are unmatched. The Sleeper partnership is only going to widen that gap.

If you care about **politics and global events**, Polymarket is still king. Their 2024 election markets set the standard, and their global platform covers international events that Kalshi simply doesn't touch.

For **crypto markets**, both platforms are competitive, though Kalshi has been expanding aggressively in this area with 50+ crypto-specific contracts.

### User Experience

**Winner: Kalshi (for US beginners)**

Kalshi feels like a traditional brokerage app. You sign up, link your bank, deposit dollars, and start trading. The mobile apps (iOS and Android) are polished, with push notifications, trending markets, and full account management.

Polymarket's global platform requires crypto familiarity — wallets, USDC, Polygon network. For crypto-native users, it's seamless. For everyone else, it's a barrier. The US platform aims to fix this with traditional banking integration, but access is still limited.

### Regulation and Safety

**Winner: Kalshi (for now)**

Kalshi has been CFTC-regulated since day one. Your funds sit in segregated US bank accounts. You get 1099 tax forms. There's an established regulatory track record.

Polymarket US is *also* CFTC-regulated now (through its QCX acquisition), but it's a newer entity with a shorter track record. The global platform operates offshore with crypto-based settlement — great for privacy and global access, less reassuring if you want traditional financial protections.

Both platforms are legitimate. But if regulatory certainty is your top priority, Kalshi's longer track record matters.

### Liquidity

**Winner: Split**

Polymarket ended 2025 with $33.4 billion in volume. Kalshi cleared $43.1 billion. But the composition is very different:

- **Polymarket:** Strongest liquidity in politics, crypto, and global events
- **Kalshi:** Strongest liquidity in US sports (which drove 90%+ of their 2025 volume)

For any given market, check the order book depth before placing a trade. Thin markets mean wider spreads and worse fills, regardless of which platform you're on.

## Which One Should You Use?

Here's how I'd think about it:

**Choose Kalshi if:**
- You're in the US and want the simplest onboarding experience
- You mainly trade US sports events
- You prefer traditional banking (ACH deposits, no crypto required)
- Regulatory protection and tax documentation matter to you
- You want native mobile apps on both iOS and Android

**Choose Polymarket if:**
- You're interested in political markets and global events
- You're comfortable with crypto (or willing to learn)
- You want the lowest possible fees
- You want to provide liquidity and earn maker rebates
- You're outside the US

**Use both if:**
- You trade across multiple categories and want the best liquidity in each
- You're a serious prediction market user who shops for the best odds

If you're completely new to this, Kalshi is the safer starting point. You can fund your account with a bank transfer, the interface is intuitive, and the regulatory framework is well-established. Once you're comfortable with how prediction markets work, you might explore Polymarket for its deeper political markets and lower fees.

## The Bored at Work Angle

So why am I writing about prediction markets on a site about being productive at work?

Because prediction markets are genuinely one of the most interesting ways to learn about probability, information markets, and how the world actually works. Following prediction markets makes you a better-calibrated thinker. When you have to put a number on "How likely is this?", you start noticing how often your gut feelings are wildly off.

You don't have to trade with real money to get this benefit. Just watching the markets — seeing how prices move in response to news, noticing where the market disagrees with the pundits — is an education in itself.

If you want to go deeper on markets and economics, our [free investing courses guide](/best-free-investing-courses/) covers platforms where you can learn the fundamentals without spending a dime. And if you're just looking for [more ways to stay sharp during slow days at the office](/productive-things-bored-at-work/), understanding prediction markets is a surprisingly useful skill.

Whether you're actually trading or just market-watching, prediction markets turn "I think this will happen" into "I think this will happen, and here's my confidence level." That's a mental model worth developing — even if you never place a single trade.

## Frequently Asked Questions
