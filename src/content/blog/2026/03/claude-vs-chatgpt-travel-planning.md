ChatGPT gets all the hype for travel planning, but Claude has quietly become a serious contender. We tested both AI assistants on the same travel planning tasks to find out which one actually helps you plan better trips.

## The Test Setup

We gave both AIs identical prompts for:
1. A 10-day Japan trip (complex, multi-city)
2. A weekend Paris getaway (simple, focused)
3. An off-the-beaten-path Portugal road trip (requires creativity)
4. Detailed restaurant recommendations for Rome (specificity test)

Here's what we found.

## Test 1: 10-Day Japan Trip

**The prompt**: "Plan a 10-day first-timer trip to Japan covering Tokyo, Kyoto, and one other destination. Mid-range budget, interested in food, culture, and nature."

### ChatGPT's Response

Fast and structured. Within 30 seconds, ChatGPT delivered:
- A clean day-by-day breakdown
- Standard but solid route (Tokyo → Kyoto → Osaka)
- Practical tips for JR Pass
- Popular restaurant areas

**Strengths**: Quick, well-organized, covered the basics well.

**Weaknesses**: Felt like every other Japan itinerary. "Visit Senso-ji, see Fushimi Inari, eat at Tsukiji"—nothing surprising.

### Claude's Response

Slower but deeper. Claude took longer but provided:
- Thoughtful reasoning for each recommendation
- Less obvious destination choice (suggested Kanazawa instead of Osaka)
- Specific neighborhood recommendations
- Cultural context for each activity
- Honest notes about what's overrated

**Strengths**: More nuanced, better for experienced travelers, included the "why" behind each suggestion.

**Weaknesses**: Sometimes too detailed for quick planning.

### Winner: Tie
- **For first-timers**: ChatGPT (clearer, simpler)
- **For experienced travelers**: Claude (more depth)

## Test 2: Weekend Paris Getaway

**The prompt**: "I have 3 days in Paris next month. Not my first time—I've done the Eiffel Tower and Louvre. What should I actually do?"

### ChatGPT's Response

Still gave some standard recommendations despite our caveat. Suggested Musée d'Orsay (fair), Montmartre (fair), and... the Louvre's less-visited sections (we said we'd done it).

### Claude's Response

Actually listened. Suggested:
- The Marais for vintage shopping and falafel
- Père Lachaise cemetery exploration
- Day trip to Giverny (Monet's garden)
- Specific wine bars in the 11th
- A food tour of the immigrant neighborhoods

Claude also asked clarifying questions: "Are you interested in food, art, nightlife, or something else?"

### Winner: Claude

Claude's ability to understand nuance ("not my first time") made a significant difference.

## Test 3: Off-the-Beaten-Path Portugal

**The prompt**: "I want to road trip through Portugal for 2 weeks, avoiding the tourist hotspots. I want to feel like a local, not a tourist."

### ChatGPT's Response

Listed Lisbon, Porto, and the Algarve. When pushed for less touristy options, added Sintra and Évora—still very much on the tourist trail.

### Claude's Response

Delivered exactly what we asked for:
- Marvão (hilltop village near the Spanish border)
- The Alentejo wine region
- Coastal villages between Lisbon and Porto that tourists skip
- Specific local restaurants with no English menus
- Festivals happening during travel dates
- Routes avoiding the A-roads

Claude even noted: "Fair warning—some of these places have limited English signage. That's part of the charm, but be prepared."

### Winner: Claude (decisively)

For creative, off-the-grid planning, Claude outperformed ChatGPT significantly.

## Test 4: Restaurant Recommendations in Rome

**The prompt**: "Give me 5 specific restaurant recommendations in Rome. I want places locals actually eat at, with the exact dish to order."

### ChatGPT's Response

Gave 5 restaurants with dishes. Upon fact-checking:
- 2 were excellent recommendations
- 1 had changed ownership and quality
- 1 was more touristy than claimed
- 1 we couldn't verify existed

### Claude's Response

Also gave 5 restaurants, but with caveats:
- "Note: I can't verify if these are still open or if quality has changed. Please check recent reviews."
- Included neighborhood context
- Explained why each dish was significant
- Suggested backup options

Upon fact-checking:
- 4 were accurate and well-regarded
- 1 had closed (but Claude had warned to verify)

### Winner: Claude

Not because Claude was more accurate, but because Claude was more honest about limitations. That honesty helps you plan better.

## Key Differences Explained

### Context Window

**Claude** can hold more information in memory. For complex trips with lots of details, Claude remembers your preferences better across long conversations.

**ChatGPT** sometimes "forgets" earlier constraints in long planning sessions.

### Personality

**ChatGPT** is eager to please. It quickly gives confident answers, which is great for momentum but can mean less nuanced recommendations.

**Claude** is more thoughtful. It sometimes pushes back or asks clarifying questions, which slows things down but improves results.

### Tools and Integrations

**ChatGPT** wins hands-down with the Expedia plugin for checking real prices and availability.

**Claude** has no travel-specific integrations, which limits its utility for booking.

### Knowledge Approach

**ChatGPT** tends toward popular, well-documented recommendations.

**Claude** is more willing to suggest obscure options and explain trade-offs.

## When to Use Each

### Use ChatGPT When:

- You need a quick, standard itinerary
- You want to check prices and availability (Expedia plugin)
- Planning a popular destination with well-worn routes
- You're short on time and need "good enough" fast

### Use Claude When:

- Planning a complex, multi-week trip
- You want off-the-beaten-path recommendations
- You value depth and context over speed
- You're an experienced traveler who needs nuance
- You want honest caveats about limitations

### Use Both When:

This is our recommended approach:

1. **Claude for research**: Initial brainstorming, detailed itinerary, nuanced recommendations
2. **ChatGPT for booking**: Price checking with Expedia, availability confirmation
3. **Claude for refinement**: Adjusting based on constraints, getting alternatives

### For Dietary Restrictions

Both tools help with dietary needs differently:

- **Claude** gives more nuanced, honest advice ("soy sauce contains wheat in most Asian countries, but fish sauce is usually safe")
- **ChatGPT** is better at creating translation cards and quick phrase lists

For celiac disease or serious allergies, Claude's cautious approach ("verify this with the restaurant") is often more helpful than ChatGPT's confident but potentially oversimplified answers.

---

## The Verdict

**ChatGPT** is the faster, more practical choice for mainstream travel planning. If you need a solid Japan itinerary in 5 minutes with the ability to check prices, ChatGPT delivers.

**Claude** is the better choice for travelers who prioritize depth, creativity, and honest recommendations. If you're planning a complex trip and want genuine insight, Claude is worth the extra time.

**For most trips**: Start with Claude's depth, finish with ChatGPT's tools.
