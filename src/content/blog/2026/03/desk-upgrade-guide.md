faq:
  - question: "How much does a complete home office setup cost?"
    answer: "A solid setup costs $800-1,500: standing desk ($500-600), ergonomic chair ($400-600), monitor arm ($40-180), and cable management ($50). Budget setups start around $600. Premium setups with Herman Miller chairs and Ergotron arms run $2,000-3,000. Prioritize the chair first—it affects your health most."
  - question: "What should I upgrade first in my home office?"
    answer: "Upgrade in this order: 1) Chair (biggest health impact), 2) Monitor position (arm or stand), 3) Desk (standing desk if budget allows), 4) Cable management (cosmetic but satisfying). A good chair matters more than a fancy desk. Don't cheap out on what supports your body 8 hours a day."
  - question: "Is a standing desk worth it?"
    answer: "Yes, if you actually use it. Standing desks help with back pain, energy levels, and posture—but only if you alternate between sitting and standing. Most people stand 2-4 hours per day. If you'll just leave it at sitting height, save the money. The health benefit comes from movement, not standing all day."
  - question: "What's the best budget home office setup?"
    answer: "Best budget setup (~$600): Branch Duo desk ($549), HON Ignition 2.0 chair ($400), VIVO monitor arm ($40), and basic cable management ($45). This gives you a standing desk, decent ergonomics, and a clean look without breaking the bank. Upgrade the chair first when budget allows."
  - question: "Do I need a standing desk if I have a good chair?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. A good chair is more important than a standing desk. But if you sit 8+ hours daily, a standing desk adds valuable movement to your day. The combination of good chair + standing desk is ideal. If budget is tight, prioritize the chair—you can add a desk converter later for $150-300."
  - question: "How do I set up an ergonomic workspace?"
    answer: "Key ergonomic settings: Monitor top at eye level (use arm or stand), screen at arm's length (~24 inches), chair height so feet flat on floor, elbows at 90° when typing, lumbar support in lower back curve. Take breaks every 30-60 minutes. No setup is perfect if you sit frozen for 8 hours."
tldr: "Build your home office in this order: chair first (biggest health impact), then monitor arm, then desk, then cable management. Budget ~$1,000-1,500 for a solid setup. This guide links to detailed buying guides for each component."

## Part 1: The Desk

Your desk is the foundation. In 2026, standing desks have become affordable enough that there's little reason to buy a fixed-height desk.

### Why Standing Desks?

| Benefit | How It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Movement** | Alternate sitting/standing reduces stiffness |
| **Energy** | Standing increases alertness |
| **Back health** | Reduces pressure on spine |
| **Flexibility** | Adjust to perfect height for any task |

**The key:** You don't stand all day. You alternate. Most people stand 2-4 hours total, in 30-60 minute intervals.

### Standing Desk Recommendations

| Desk | Price | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **FlexiSpot E7 Pro** | ~$500 | Best overall — stability + value |
| **Uplift V2** | ~$599+ | Best customization — 20+ desktop materials |
| **Branch Duo** | ~$549 | Best budget — includes storage shelf |

**What to look for:**
- Dual motors (not single motor)
- 300+ lb weight capacity
- 10+ year frame warranty
- Height range that fits you (25" to 50"+)

## Part 2: The Chair

Your chair matters more than your desk. You can work at a mediocre desk, but a bad chair will wreck your back.

### What Makes a Good Office Chair?

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Adjustable lumbar support** | Supports your lower back curve |
| **Seat height adjustment** | Feet flat on floor, thighs parallel |
| **Armrest adjustment** | Prevents shoulder strain |
| **Seat depth adjustment** | Fits different leg lengths |
| **Quality build** | Lasts 7-15 years |

**Red flag:** If it has a fixed lumbar pillow instead of adjustable support, skip it.

### Office Chair Recommendations

| Chair | Price | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Branch Ergonomic Chair Pro** | ~$500 | Best value — 14 adjustment points |
| **Herman Miller Aeron** | ~$1,400+ | Best premium — 12-year warranty, lasts forever |
| **Secretlab Titan Evo** | ~$550+ | Best for gaming + work |
| **HON Ignition 2.0** | ~$400 | Best budget — solid ergonomics |

**Upgrade order:** If budget is tight, get the chair first. Add the desk later.

## Part 3: Monitor Position

Most people put their monitor on its included stand. This is almost always wrong—the screen ends up too low, causing neck strain.

### The Problem with Monitor Stands

| Issue | Why It's Bad |
|-------|--------------|
| **Too low** | Forces you to look down, strains neck |
| **Fixed position** | Can't adjust for sitting vs standing |
| **Wastes desk space** | Stand footprint takes valuable real estate |

### The Solution: Monitor Arm

A monitor arm lets you:
- Position screen at perfect eye level
- Push monitor back for more desk space
- Easily adjust between sitting and standing
- Swivel screen for collaboration or reading

### Monitor Arm Recommendations

| Arm | Price | Best For |
|-----|-------|----------|
| **Ergotron LX** | ~$179 | Best quality — 10-year warranty |
| **Amazon Basics Premium** | ~$110 | Best mid-range |
| **VIVO Premium Aluminum** | ~$40 | Best budget — handles most monitors |

**For dual monitors:** VIVO Dual (~$45) or Ergotron LX Dual (~$350)

## Part 4: Cable Management

Cable management is the finishing touch that makes your setup look professional instead of chaotic.

### Why Bother?

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Looks clean** | Professional video call background |
| **Easier cleaning** | No cables on floor |
| **Less stress** | Organized space = organized mind |
| **Safer** | No trip hazards |

### Essential Cable Management Products

| Product | Price | What It Does |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Under-desk cable tray** | ~$20-35 | Hides power strip + excess cables |
| **Velcro ties (50-pack)** | ~$10 | Bundles cables together |
| **Adhesive cable clips** | ~$10 | Routes cables along surfaces |
| **J-channel raceway** | ~$15 | Hides cables on desk underside |

**Total investment:** ~$50 for a dramatically cleaner setup

## Upgrade Priority Order

If you can't buy everything at once, upgrade in this order:

### 1. Chair (First Priority)

**Why:** Directly affects your health. A bad chair causes back pain that compounds over time. You can work at any desk, but you can't work with chronic back pain.

**Budget:** At least $400. Don't go cheaper.

### 2. Monitor Position (Second Priority)

**Why:** Neck strain from looking down is almost as bad as back pain. A $40 monitor arm fixes this immediately.

**Budget:** $40-180 depending on quality preference.

### 3. Desk (Third Priority)

**Why:** A standing desk adds healthy movement, but it's less critical than chair and monitor. Your current desk works fine while you save up.

**Budget:** $500-700 for a good standing desk.

### 4. Cable Management (Last Priority)

**Why:** Purely cosmetic. Nice to have, not need to have. Do this when everything else is sorted.

**Budget:** $50-80 covers everything.

## Ergonomic Setup Checklist

Once you have your gear, set it up correctly:

### Chair Setup
- [ ] Feet flat on floor (or footrest)
- [ ] Thighs parallel to floor
- [ ] Lumbar support in lower back curve
- [ ] Armrests at elbow height
- [ ] Back fully supported

### Monitor Setup
- [ ] Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- [ ] Screen at arm's length (~20-26 inches)
- [ ] Slight backward tilt (10-20°)
- [ ] Centered in front of you

### Desk Setup
- [ ] Keyboard at elbow height when typing
- [ ] Mouse at same level as keyboard
- [ ] Frequently used items within arm's reach
- [ ] Standing height: elbows at 90° while typing

### Habits
- [ ] Alternate sitting/standing every 30-60 minutes
- [ ] Take short breaks every hour
- [ ] Look away from screen every 20 minutes (20-20-20 rule)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Buying the Desk First

The chair affects your health more. A great desk with a terrible chair is worse than a basic desk with a great chair.

### 2. Skipping the Monitor Arm

"My monitor stand is fine" — it's almost certainly too low. Spend $40 on a basic arm and your neck will thank you.

### 3. Cheaping Out on the Chair

A $100 chair that lasts 2 years and hurts your back costs more than a $500 chair that lasts 10 years and feels great.

### 4. Over-Buying on Day One

Start with the basics. You can always upgrade. Many people buy premium everything and realize they didn't need it.

### 5. Ignoring Ergonomics

The best gear set up wrong is worse than average gear set up right. Spend 10 minutes adjusting everything properly.
