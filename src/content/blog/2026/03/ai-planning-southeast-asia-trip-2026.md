faq:
  - question: "Can AI help choose between multiple destinations?"
    answer: "Yes! AI tools can compare destinations based on your preferences, budget, weather, and flight prices. I'm using this approach to decide between Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia for November 2026."
  - question: "How far in advance should you use AI for trip planning?"
    answer: "Start 6-12 months ahead for major trips. This gives you time to monitor flight prices, research thoroughly, and book at optimal times. I started planning my November 2026 trip in early 2026."
  - question: "Is November a good time to visit Southeast Asia?"
    answer: "It depends on the destination. November is excellent for Cambodia and Vietnam (dry season starting) and good for Japan (autumn colors). AI helped me analyze the best timing for each."

Last year, I planned a [Malaysia trip entirely with ChatGPT](/chatgpt-malaysia-trip-planning/). It worked so well that I'm doing it again—but this time, I'm documenting the entire process in real-time.

**The goal:** Plan an epic November 2026 trip to either Japan, Vietnam, or Cambodia (or a combination) using every AI tool at my disposal.

**The twist:** I built my own [AI flight search agent](/build-ai-flight-search-agent/) to find the best deals.

Follow along as I make decisions, find deals, and figure out where I'm actually going.

## The Starting Point

**When:** November 2026 (2-3 weeks)
**Who:** Me and my partner
**Budget:** Mid-range (~$150-200/day)
**Starting point:** Europe
**Special needs:** Gluten-free options (partner has celiac disease)

**The candidates:**
- 🇯🇵 **Japan** - Always dreamed of it, autumn colors
- 🇻🇳 **Vietnam** - Incredible food, good value
- 🇰🇭 **Cambodia** - Angkor Wat bucket list, beaches

I genuinely don't know which to choose yet. Let's let AI help decide.

---

## Phase 1: Initial Research (Current)

### What I Asked the AI Tools

**ChatGPT:**
```
I'm planning a 2-3 week trip in November 2026.
Comparing Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia.
Budget: $150-200/day for two people.
We love food, culture, and some beach time.
One of us has celiac disease (needs gluten-free options).

Compare these destinations for November travel.
```

**Perplexity:**
```
What's the weather like in Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia in November?
Which is best for a 2-3 week trip?
Include recent traveler experiences.
```

**My Flight Agent:**
Running daily searches for:
- Europe → Tokyo (NRT/HND)
- Europe → Hanoi (HAN) / Ho Chi Minh (SGN)
- Europe → Phnom Penh (PNH) / Siem Reap (REP)

### Initial AI Analysis

| Factor | Japan | Vietnam | Cambodia |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| November weather | Excellent (autumn) | Good (dry season starts) | Good (dry season) |
| Budget fit | Stretching it | Perfect | Perfect |
| Gluten-free ease | Good (rice-based) | Moderate | Challenging |
| Flight cost (est.) | $800-1200 | $600-900 | $700-1000 |
| Wow factor | High | High | Very high (Angkor) |

**Early leaning:** Vietnam or Cambodia offer better value, but Japan's autumn is legendary...

## Phase 2: Flight Monitoring

*This section updates as I track prices*

### Current Best Prices Found

| Route | Price | Airline | Stops | Found via |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|-----------|
| BER → NRT | $--- | --- | --- | Flight Agent |
| BER → HAN | $--- | --- | --- | Flight Agent |
| BER → REP | $--- | --- | --- | Flight Agent |

*Updating weekly as my flight agent runs*

### Price Trends

*Chart coming as I collect more data*

## Phase 3: Deep Dive Research

### Japan in November

**What AI told me:**
- Autumn foliage peaks mid-November
- Kyoto gets extremely crowded
- Tokyo → Kyoto → Osaka is classic but busy
- Consider less touristy routes

**Detailed guide:** [AI Trip Planning: Japan](/ai-trip-planning-japan/)

### Vietnam in November

**What AI told me:**
- North (Hanoi, Ha Long Bay): Cool, occasional drizzle
- Central (Hoi An, Hue): Tail end of rainy season
- South (Ho Chi Minh, Mekong): Dry season starting

**Detailed guide:** [AI Trip Planning: Vietnam](/ai-trip-planning-vietnam/)

### Cambodia in November

**What AI told me:**
- Dry season begins
- Angkor Wat less crowded than December-February
- Can combine with southern beaches
- Consider adding Siem Reap + Koh Rong

## Phase 4: The Decision

*Coming soon—currently gathering data*

### Decision Framework (AI-Assisted)

I asked Claude to help me build a decision matrix:

```
Help me decide between Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia for November.
Weight these factors by importance to me:
- Unique experiences (high)
- Food scene (high)
- Budget fit (medium)
- Gluten-free ease (high)
- Weather (medium)
- Flight cost (medium)
```

**Results:** *Updating as I refine*

## Phase 5: Booking

*Coming soon*

### What I'll Book with AI Help

- [ ] Flights (via my flight agent alerts)
- [ ] Travel insurance (AI-researched coverage needs)
- [ ] Accommodation (ChatGPT recommendations)
- [ ] Key experiences (Perplexity research)
- [ ] Restaurant list (gluten-free focused)

### Travel Insurance Research

I asked Perplexity to compare insurance needs for my three destination options:

```
Compare travel insurance requirements for Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia.
What coverage is essential for each?
What activities need special coverage?
Evacuation coverage importance for each destination?
```

**Result:** Cambodia requires the most coverage (evacuation essential), Japan needs high medical coverage (expensive hospitals), Vietnam needs motorbike coverage if renting.

## Lessons Learned So Far

### What's Working

✅ **Flight agent monitoring** - Already seeing price patterns
✅ **Perplexity for research** - Great for current conditions
✅ **ChatGPT for comparison** - Good at weighing trade-offs

### What's Challenging

⚠️ **Too many options** - AI gives lots of ideas, hard to narrow down
⚠️ **Conflicting advice** - Different tools sometimes disagree
⚠️ **Analysis paralysis** - More data isn't always better

### Adjustments I'm Making

1. Setting a decision deadline (not endless research)
2. Trusting gut feelings alongside AI recommendations
3. Focusing on 2-3 key priorities, not optimizing everything
