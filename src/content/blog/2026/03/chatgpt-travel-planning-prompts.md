faq:
  - question: "What's the best ChatGPT prompt for travel planning?"
    answer: "The best prompts give ChatGPT a role, specify your preferences, and ask for structured output. Example: 'Act as a local travel guide for Tokyo. Create a 5-day itinerary for a first-time visitor who loves food and wants to avoid tourist traps.'"
  - question: "Should I use ChatGPT Plus for travel planning?"
    answer: "The free version works for basic planning, but ChatGPT Plus offers better accuracy and can browse the web for current information. If you're planning an expensive trip, the $20/month is worth it."
  - question: "Can ChatGPT book flights and hotels?"
    answer: "ChatGPT itself cannot book directly, but the Expedia plugin allows you to see real prices and transfer to Expedia for booking. For actual bookings, use dedicated travel sites."

ChatGPT can be an incredible travel planning assistant—if you know how to ask. The difference between a mediocre AI response and a genuinely useful one comes down to your prompts.

Here are 15 proven prompts that actually work, organized by planning stage.

## The Golden Rule of Travel Prompts

Before we dive in, remember this: **give ChatGPT a role**. Instead of asking "What should I do in Paris?", try "You are a local Parisian who has lived in the city for 20 years..."

This simple trick dramatically improves response quality.

## Pro Tips for Better Results

### Iterate, Don't Accept

Never accept the first response. Always follow up:

### Combine with Verification

Use ChatGPT for the plan, then verify with:

- **Official websites** - opening hours and prices
- **Recent reviews** - current conditions
- **Reddit** - real traveler experiences

### Save Your Good Prompts

When a prompt works well, save it. Create a travel planning template you can reuse and refine for each trip.
