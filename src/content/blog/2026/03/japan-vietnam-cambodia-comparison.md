Three incredible destinations. One trip. How do you choose?

Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia each offer something unique. I'm facing this exact decision for my November 2026 trip, so I used AI to systematically compare them.

Here's the breakdown to help you decide.

## The Quick Comparison

| Factor | Japan | Vietnam | Cambodia |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Daily Budget** | $100-200 | $30-80 | $30-80 |
| **Flight Cost (from Europe)** | $800-1200 | $600-900 | $700-1000 |
| **November Weather** | Excellent | Good (varies) | Excellent |
| **English Spoken** | Moderate | Moderate | Basic |
| **Wow Factor** | Autumn colors | Food scene | Angkor Wat |
| **Ease of Travel** | Very easy | Easy | Easy |
| **Crowds** | High | Moderate | Low |
| **Gluten-Free Ease** | Good | Challenging | Moderate |

---

## Budget Breakdown (AI-Calculated)

I asked AI to calculate realistic daily budgets for each destination.

### Japan: $100-200/day

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range | Comfort |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Accommodation | $40-60 | $80-120 | $150+ |
| Food | $30-40 | $50-80 | $100+ |
| Transport | $20-30 | $30-50 | $50+ |
| Activities | $10-20 | $30-50 | $50+ |

**Total for 2 weeks:** $1,400-2,800+

### Vietnam: $30-80/day

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range | Comfort |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Accommodation | $10-20 | $30-50 | $60-100 |
| Food | $10-15 | $20-30 | $40-60 |
| Transport | $5-10 | $10-20 | $20-30 |
| Activities | $5-10 | $15-25 | $30-50 |

**Total for 2 weeks:** $420-1,120

### Cambodia: $30-80/day

| Category | Budget | Mid-Range | Comfort |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Accommodation | $10-25 | $30-50 | $60-100 |
| Food | $8-15 | $15-25 | $30-50 |
| Transport | $5-10 | $10-15 | $15-25 |
| Activities | $10-15 | $20-35 | $40-60 |

**Total for 2 weeks:** $420-1,120

**AI insight:** Vietnam and Cambodia are nearly identical in cost. Japan is 2-3x more expensive but offers a fundamentally different experience.

## November Weather Comparison

Since I'm planning for November 2026, I asked AI to analyze the weather.

### Japan in November

| Region | Weather | Highlights |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Tokyo | Cool (10-18°C), dry | Autumn colors beginning |
| Kyoto | Cool (8-17°C), dry | Peak autumn foliage mid-November |
| Osaka | Mild (10-18°C), dry | Late autumn colors |

**Verdict:** Excellent. November is one of Japan's best months.

### Vietnam in November

| Region | Weather | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| North (Hanoi) | Cool (17-24°C), dry | Pleasant but cooler |
| Central (Hoi An) | Rainy season ending | Risk of rain, especially early November |
| South (HCMC) | Dry season starting | Warm (25-32°C), low humidity |

**Verdict:** Good, but requires planning. Central Vietnam is risky.

### Cambodia in November

| Region | Weather | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Siem Reap | Dry season starting | Perfect for temples |
| Phnom Penh | Dry season starting | Comfortable |
| Coast (Sihanoukville) | Dry season starting | Beach-ready |

**Verdict:** Excellent. November is ideal for Cambodia.

**AI recommendation for November:**
```
1. Cambodia - Best weather, dry season just starting
2. Japan - Autumn colors peak mid-November
3. Vietnam - Good but Central region is risky
```

## AI Decision Matrix

I asked AI to create a weighted comparison based on my priorities.

### My Priorities (Weighted):
- Unique experiences: High
- Food scene: High
- Budget fit ($150/day): Medium
- Gluten-free ease: High (partner has celiac)
- November weather: Medium

### AI Scoring (1-10):

| Factor | Weight | Japan | Vietnam | Cambodia |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| Unique experiences | 3x | 9 | 8 | 9 |
| Food scene | 3x | 9 | 10 | 7 |
| Budget fit | 2x | 5 | 9 | 9 |
| Gluten-free ease | 3x | 7 | 5 | 6 |
| November weather | 2x | 9 | 7 | 9 |
| **Weighted Total** | | **98** | **97** | **102** |

**AI conclusion:** Cambodia edges out slightly due to budget fit and weather, but all three score closely. The decision comes down to what you prioritize most.

## Combining Destinations

Can you visit multiple countries? Here's what AI recommends:

### Vietnam + Cambodia (Easy Combination)

- Flight time: 1 hour (HCMC → Siem Reap)
- Cost: Same budget level
- Suggested itinerary:
  ```
  2 weeks: Vietnam (10 days) → Cambodia (4 days)
  3 weeks: Vietnam (14 days) → Cambodia (7 days)
  ```

**Works well because:** Similar prices, easy flights, different experiences.

### Japan + Southeast Asia (Challenging)

- Requires significantly higher budget
- Long flight between (5+ hours)
- Different travel pace
- Better as separate trips

**AI advice:** If you're set on Japan, do it properly. Don't rush it by adding Vietnam/Cambodia.

### The Multi-Country Prompt

```
I have [X] weeks and [$X] budget.
Can I combine Japan with Vietnam or Cambodia?
Consider:
- Flight costs between countries
- Time lost to travel days
- Budget differences
- Is it better as separate trips?
```

## Special Considerations

### For Gluten-Free Travelers

| Destination | Difficulty | Key Issues | AI Rating |
|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Japan | Moderate | Soy sauce contains wheat; tamari available | 7/10 |
| Vietnam | Challenging | Fish sauce OK; soy sauce common; similar-looking noodles | 5/10 |
| Cambodia | Moderate | Fish sauce usually safe; less soy sauce than Vietnam | 6/10 |

**My situation:** Partner has celiac disease. Japan is safest due to rice-based cuisine and awareness. Cambodia is doable. Vietnam requires the most vigilance.

### For Photography

| Destination | Best Subjects | November Conditions |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Japan | Autumn colors, temples, cityscapes | Perfect light, vibrant colors |
| Vietnam | Street life, landscapes, food | Good but Central region weather risk |
| Cambodia | Temples, sunrise, floating villages | Excellent, green from recent rains |

### For First-Time Asia Travelers

**AI ranking:**
1. **Japan** - Easiest, most comfortable, safest
2. **Vietnam** - More challenging but very rewarding
3. **Cambodia** - Easy but less infrastructure

### Travel Insurance Considerations

| Destination | Healthcare Quality | Evacuation Needed? | Insurance Priority |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Japan | Excellent but expensive | Rarely | Medical costs coverage |
| Vietnam | Variable (cities vs rural) | Sometimes | Motorbike coverage + evacuation |
| Cambodia | Limited | Yes, for serious issues | Evacuation coverage essential |

**AI-assisted insurance research:**
```
Compare travel insurance needs for Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia.
What coverage is essential for each?
Which destination requires the highest coverage amounts?
```

## My Current Decision (November 2026)

After all this analysis, where am I leaning?

### The Honest Assessment

| Destination | Pull Factor | Hesitation |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Japan | Autumn colors, bucket list | Budget stretch, crowds |
| Vietnam | Food, value | Central weather risk, gluten concerns |
| Cambodia | Angkor Wat, value, timing | Less variety |

### AI's Final Recommendation for Me

```
Given your priorities (unique experiences, food, gluten-free needs,
$150/day budget, November timing):

Recommendation: Cambodia

Why:
- November is perfect timing
- Angkor Wat is genuinely bucket-list worthy
- Budget fits comfortably
- Gluten-free is manageable (better than Vietnam)
- Can add beaches for variety

Runner-up: Japan (if you stretch budget)
- Autumn colors are unmatched
- Gluten-free is easier
- But costs significantly more

Consider saving Vietnam for:
- A different time of year (avoid Central in November)
- When you have more time (it deserves 3+ weeks)
```
