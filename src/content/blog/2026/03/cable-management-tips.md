faq:
  - question: "What is the best way to manage cables under a desk?"
    answer: "Use a cable management tray mounted under your desk to hold power strips and excess cable length. Route cables through J-channel raceways attached to the desk's underside. Bundle cables with velcro ties (not zip ties—they're reusable). This three-step approach handles 90% of desk cable mess."
  - question: "How do I hide cables on a standing desk?"
    answer: "Standing desks need extra cable slack for height adjustment. Use a cable management spine or flexible cable sleeve that expands and contracts with the desk. Mount your power strip to the desk frame (not the wall) so it moves with the desk. Leave 6-12 inches of slack at connection points."
  - question: "Are cable management trays worth it?"
    answer: "Yes, a $20-40 cable tray is one of the best desk upgrades. It hides your power strip and excess cables completely, keeps them off the floor (easier cleaning), and makes your setup look professional. Even a basic tray makes a huge difference."
  - question: "What's the difference between cable clips and cable ties?"
    answer: "Cable clips attach to surfaces (desk edge, wall) to route cables along a path. Cable ties bundle multiple cables together. You need both: clips to guide cables where you want them, ties to keep bundles neat. Use velcro ties instead of zip ties—they're reusable and adjustable."
  - question: "How do I manage cables behind a TV or monitor?"
    answer: "Use a cable raceway (cord cover) that matches your wall color. Route all cables through a single raceway from TV to floor. At the bottom, use a cable box to hide the power strip and excess length. For wall-mounted TVs, consider in-wall cable routing for a completely clean look."
  - question: "What cable management products do I actually need?"
    answer: "Start with three essentials: 1) Under-desk cable tray (~$25) for power strip and excess cables, 2) Velcro ties (~$8 for 50-pack) to bundle cables, 3) Cable clips (~$10) to route cables along desk edge. Total investment: under $50 for a dramatically cleaner setup."
tldr: "Start with a cable tray under your desk (~$25), velcro ties for bundling (~$8), and cable clips for routing (~$10). That's under $50 for a clean setup. For standing desks, add a cable spine (~$15). Don't overthink it—these basics handle 90% of cable mess."

A tangle of cables ruins even the best desk setup. You spent money on a nice monitor, keyboard, and chair—but your workspace still looks like a server room explosion.

Good news: cable management isn't complicated or expensive. With $30-50 in products and an hour of work, you can transform your desk from chaos to clean.

This guide covers the practical approach—what actually works, what products are worth buying, and a step-by-step process to get it done.

## The Cable Management Mindset

Before buying products, understand the goal: **every cable needs a home, a path, and a place to hide excess length.**

| Element | What It Means | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Home** | Where the cable connects | Keep connections accessible |
| **Path** | How it gets from A to B | Route along edges, out of sight |
| **Excess** | Extra cable length | Bundle and hide under desk |

Most cable mess comes from excess length. That 6-foot power cable only needs 2 feet, but the extra 4 feet creates chaos.

## Essential Cable Management Products

You don't need dozens of products. These four handle 90% of situations.

### 1. Under-Desk Cable Tray (~$20-40)

**What it does:** Holds your power strip and excess cables completely out of sight.

**Best options:**
| Product | Price | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **VIVO Cable Tray** | ~$20 | Budget pick |
| **Stand Up Desk Store Tray** | ~$30 | Standing desks (doubles as privacy panel) |
| **Fully WireTamer** | ~$35 | Premium look |

**Pro tip:** Get a tray at least 16" wide. Your power strip plus adapter bricks need room.

---

### 2. Velcro Cable Ties (~$8-12 for 50-pack)

**What they do:** Bundle cables together into neat groups.

**Why velcro, not zip ties:**
- Reusable (zip ties are one-time use)
- Adjustable (add or remove cables later)
- Won't damage cables (zip ties can cut into insulation)

**Best option:** VELCRO Brand ONE-WRAP ties—the original and still the best. A 50-pack costs ~$10 and lasts years.

---

### 3. Adhesive Cable Clips (~$8-15)

**What they do:** Route cables along surfaces—desk edge, wall, desk leg.

**Types:**
| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Single clips** | Individual cables (charging cables, headphone cable) |
| **Multi-channel clips** | Multiple cables running same direction |
| **3M Command clips** | Damage-free removal (rentals) |

**Pro tip:** Place clips every 12-18 inches along your cable path.

---

### 4. J-Channel Raceway (~$15-25)

**What it does:** Hides cables running along the underside of your desk.

**Best options:**
| Product | Length | Price |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **SimpleCord J-Channel** | 5x 16" pieces | ~$15 |
| **EVEO J-Channel** | 6x 16" pieces | ~$20 |
| **Delamu Cable Management** | 4x 16" pieces + accessories | ~$18 |

**Installation:** Adhesive backing. Clean surface with alcohol, press firmly, wait 24 hours before loading with cables.

## Standing Desk Cable Management

Standing desks need special consideration—cables must handle 12-20 inches of height change.

### The Problem

Fixed cable routing breaks when the desk moves. Cables either:
- Pull tight and stress connections
- Hang loose and look messy at standing height

### The Solution: Cable Management Spine

A cable spine is a flexible, articulated tube that expands and contracts with your desk.

**Best options:**
| Product | Price | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **VIVO Cable Spine** | ~$15 | Budget pick, works well |
| **Scandinavian Hub Spine** | ~$25 | Cleaner look |
| **Fully Cable Spine** | ~$40 | Premium, color-matched |

### Standing Desk Cable Rules

1. **Mount power strip to desk frame** — Not the wall. It moves with the desk.
2. **Leave slack at connections** — 6-12 inches at each end
3. **Use spine for desk-to-floor run** — This is the moving section
4. **Keep adapters in under-desk tray** — They don't need to move

## Step-by-Step Cable Management Guide

Set aside 1-2 hours. You'll need: cable tray, velcro ties, clips, and a clean cloth with rubbing alcohol.

### Step 1: Unplug Everything

Take a photo first (for reference), then unplug all cables. This is the only way to do it properly.

### Step 2: Clean Surfaces

Wipe desk underside and edges with rubbing alcohol. Adhesive products need clean, dry surfaces.

### Step 3: Plan Your Layout

Identify:
- Where your power strip will live (cable tray)
- Cable paths (along back edge, down desk leg)
- Connection points (where cables plug into devices)

**Sketch it out.** 5 minutes of planning saves 30 minutes of redoing.

### Step 4: Install Cable Tray

Mount the tray toward the back of your desk, centered or slightly off-center toward your power outlet side.

**For screw-mount trays:** Use the provided screws. More secure, permanent.
**For clamp-mount trays:** Attach to desk edge. Easy to remove later.

### Step 5: Route Power First

1. Put power strip in tray
2. Run power cord along desk edge using clips
3. Run it down one desk leg to the floor
4. Connect to wall outlet

This is your "trunk line"—everything else connects to it.

### Step 6: Bundle and Route Device Cables

For each device (monitor, laptop charger, desk lamp):
1. Connect to power strip
2. Coil excess cable length
3. Secure coil with velcro tie
4. Place coil in cable tray
5. Route visible portion along desk edge with clips

### Step 7: Handle Desktop Cables

Cables that reach your desktop (keyboard, mouse, charging cables):
1. Route along back edge of desk
2. Use desktop cable clips or grommets
3. Keep only needed length on desktop surface

### Step 8: Final Cleanup

- Tighten all velcro ties
- Press adhesive clips firmly
- Check all connections work
- Take a photo of your clean setup (motivation for maintenance)

## Cable Management by Situation

### Home Office Desk

**Typical cables:** Monitor, laptop charger, desk lamp, phone charger, speakers

**Setup:**
- Cable tray with power strip (under desk, back center)
- Route all power cables to tray
- Desktop charging cable with single clip at desk edge
- Total products needed: ~$40

### Gaming Setup

**Typical cables:** Multiple monitors, PC, peripherals, RGB lighting, headset

**Setup:**
- Large cable tray (or two smaller ones)
- Cable raceway for PC-to-desk runs
- Dedicated USB hub mounted under desk

- Total products needed: ~$60-80

### Standing Desk

**Typical cables:** Same as home office + height adjustment needs

**Setup:**
- Cable tray mounted to desk frame
- Cable spine for desk-to-floor
- Extra slack at all connection points
- Power strip moves with desk
- Total products needed: ~$50-70

### Dual Monitor Setup

**Typical cables:** Two display cables, power for both, USB hub

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Using Zip Ties for Everything

Zip ties are permanent. One cable change means cutting them all. Use velcro ties instead—they're reusable and adjustable.

### 2. Buying Too Many Products

Start with the basics (tray, ties, clips). Add more only if needed. Most people overbuy cable management gear.

### 3. Ignoring Cable Length

The #1 cause of cable mess is excess length. Coil and secure extra cable—don't let it hang loose.

### 4. Routing Cables Across Walking Paths

Floor cables are trip hazards. Route along walls, under rugs, or through cable raceways mounted to baseboards.

### 5. Forgetting Maintenance Access

Don't bundle everything so tightly you can't swap a cable. Leave some flexibility for future changes.

### 6. Skipping the Tray

An under-desk cable tray does 50% of the work. It's the single best cable management purchase.
