faq:
  - question: "What is the best AI tool for work in 2026?"
    answer: "It depends on your use case. ChatGPT is the most versatile all-rounder. Claude excels at writing and analysis. Gemini integrates best with Google Workspace. Perplexity is best for research. Most professionals benefit from having 2-3 AI tools for different tasks."
  - question: "Are AI tools safe to use at work?"
    answer: "Generally yes, but with precautions. Never paste confidential data into public AI tools. Check if your company has approved AI tools. Use enterprise versions when handling sensitive information. Many AI providers offer business plans with data privacy guarantees."
  - question: "How much do AI tools cost?"
    answer: "Most AI assistants have free tiers with limited usage. Premium subscriptions typically cost $20/month (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Gemini Advanced). Specialized tools like Jasper or Copy.ai range from $39-99/month. Many offer team/enterprise pricing."
  - question: "Can AI replace my job?"
    answer: "AI is more likely to change jobs than replace them entirely. Workers who learn to use AI effectively will have an advantage. Think of AI as a power tool—it amplifies your capabilities rather than replacing them. The key is learning which tasks to delegate to AI."
  - question: "Which AI tool is best for writing?"
    answer: "Claude is widely considered the best for long-form writing and nuanced content. ChatGPT is excellent for versatile writing tasks. Jasper and Copy.ai are specialized for marketing copy. For grammar and style, Grammarly remains the gold standard."
  - question: "Do I need to pay for AI tools or are free versions enough?"
    answer: "Free versions work well for casual use and learning. Upgrade to paid if you: hit usage limits regularly, need faster responses, want the latest models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5), or require advanced features like file uploads and web browsing."
tldr: "Start with ChatGPT (free tier) to learn AI basics. Add Claude for writing-heavy work. Use Perplexity for research. Specialize with tools like Otter.ai for meetings or Grammarly for editing. Don't pay until you hit free tier limits."
