faq:
  - question: "Can ChatGPT summarize PDFs?"
    answer: "Yes, ChatGPT can analyze PDFs you upload directly. The free tier allows file uploads, though with some limits. For very long documents (100+ pages), dedicated PDF tools like Claude or ChatPDF may work better."
  - question: "What's the best free AI PDF summarizer?"
    answer: "ChatGPT's free tier handles most PDFs well. Claude's free tier is excellent for long documents (200K context). For unlimited free usage, Google's NotebookLM works with multiple documents without limits."
  - question: "Can AI summarize a 100-page PDF?"
    answer: "Yes, several tools handle very long documents. Claude (200K tokens ≈ 150K words), ChatGPT (128K tokens), and Gemini (1M+ tokens for paid) can all process book-length content. Dedicated tools like ChatPDF also work well."
  - question: "Is it safe to upload confidential PDFs to AI tools?"
    answer: "It depends on the tool and your needs. Most AI tools use uploaded data for training by default—check privacy settings. For sensitive documents, use Claude (better privacy defaults), enterprise plans, or local tools like Ollama."
  - question: "What can AI PDF tools actually do?"
    answer: "Summarize documents, answer questions about content, extract specific information, compare multiple documents, find inconsistencies, translate content, and explain complex sections in simpler terms."
tldr: "For most people: ChatGPT or Claude (both free tiers work). For research with multiple sources: NotebookLM (free, Google). For heavy PDF work: ChatPDF or Humata ($10-15/mo). Always verify AI summaries against the original for important work."

## How to Get Better Results

### Be Specific About What You Want

**Vague:** "Summarize this"

**Better:** "Summarize this report in 5 bullet points, focusing on the financial implications. Keep each point under 20 words."

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

Don't try to get everything in one prompt:
1. "What's the main argument of this paper?"
2. "What evidence supports that argument?"
3. "What are the limitations mentioned?"

### Use the Right Tool for the Length

| Document Length | Best Tool |
|-----------------|-----------|
| 1-20 pages | Any tool works |
| 20-50 pages | ChatGPT, Claude |
| 50-100 pages | Claude, NotebookLM |
| 100+ pages | Claude |
| Multiple documents | NotebookLM |

### Verify Important Information

AI summarizers can miss details or misinterpret context. For anything important:
- Cross-reference key claims with the original
- Ask for page numbers: "Where in the document does it say this?"
- Use multiple prompts to check consistency

---

## Privacy Considerations

Before uploading sensitive documents:

| Tool | Data Usage | Enterprise Option |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| ChatGPT | May train on data (opt-out available) | Yes (Team/Enterprise) |
| Claude | Better privacy defaults | Yes (Team) |
| NotebookLM | Google's data practices | Google Workspace |
| ChatPDF | Check current policy | No |
| Gemini | Google's data practices | Yes |

**For confidential documents:**
1. Check the tool's privacy policy
2. Use enterprise/team versions with data protection
3. Consider local AI tools (Ollama) for maximum privacy
4. Never upload truly sensitive data to free consumer tools

---

## Quick-Start Prompts

Copy these for common tasks:

**Executive Summary:**
```
Create an executive summary of this document in 5-7 bullet points. 
Focus on: key findings, recommendations, and action items. 
Write for a busy executive who has 2 minutes.
```

**Find Specific Information:**
```
Find all mentions of [TOPIC] in this document. 
For each mention, give me the context and page number.
```

**Compare Sections:**
```
Compare the methodology in section [X] with the results in section [Y]. 
Are there any inconsistencies?
```

**Simplify Complex Content:**

Explain section [X] in simple terms that someone without 
[FIELD] expertise would understand.
```

**Extract Action Items:**
