faq:
  - question: "Can AI really plan a good trip?"
    answer: "Yes, but with caveats. AI excels at creating itineraries, suggesting activities, and organizing logistics. However, it can hallucinate details (wrong opening hours, non-existent restaurants), so always verify critical information. Used correctly, AI cuts trip planning time by 70-80%."
  - question: "Which AI is best for travel planning?"
    answer: "ChatGPT is best for creative itineraries and conversational planning. Perplexity AI is best for research with real-time sources. Claude excels at detailed, nuanced planning. Google Gemini offers real-time info integration. Most travelers benefit from using 2-3 tools together."
  - question: "Is AI travel planning free?"
    answer: "Yes, you can plan entire trips for free using ChatGPT (free tier), Perplexity AI, Google Gemini, and various free AI trip planners. Paid versions offer more features, but free tools are sufficient for most travelers."
