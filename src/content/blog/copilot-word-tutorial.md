faq:
  - question: "Is Copilot in Word free?"
    answer: "Copilot in Word requires Microsoft 365 Personal/Family ($13-20/month, includes Copilot) or Microsoft 365 Copilot Business ($21/user/month) for organizations. The free Copilot at copilot.microsoft.com can help with Word tasks via copy/paste but doesn't integrate directly."
  - question: "How do I enable Copilot in Word?"
    answer: "You need Microsoft 365 (Personal, Family, or Business) plus a Copilot subscription. Once subscribed, Copilot appears automatically in Word's ribbon. Look for the Copilot icon in the Home tab."
  - question: "What can Copilot do in Word?"
    answer: "Draft new documents from prompts, rewrite or improve existing text, summarize long documents, change tone (formal/casual), generate tables, answer questions about your document, and help with formatting."
  - question: "Is Copilot better than ChatGPT for Word documents?"
    answer: "For working within Word, yes—Copilot integrates directly so you don't need to copy/paste. For complex writing tasks or longer documents, ChatGPT or Claude might produce better quality. Many users use both."
  - question: "Can Copilot write an entire document for me?"
    answer: "It can generate first drafts, but they typically need editing. Copilot works best as a collaborator: it drafts, you refine. The quality depends heavily on how specific your prompts are."
tldr: "Copilot in Word is best for: quick first drafts, rewriting awkward sections, changing tone, and summarizing. Give specific prompts for better results. It won't replace good writing skills, but it significantly speeds up the drafting process. Now included in Microsoft 365 Personal/Family subscriptions."

Microsoft put AI directly into Word. No more copying to ChatGPT and back—Copilot works right where you write.

Here's everything you need to know to actually use it well.

---

## What You Need

**Requirements:**
- Microsoft 365 subscription (Personal, Family, or Business)
- Microsoft 365 Personal/Family (includes Copilot) or Copilot Business ($21/user/month for organizations)
- Word for Windows, Mac, or Word Online

**Don't have Copilot yet?**  
You can still use the free [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) for writing help—just copy/paste between Copilot and Word. Not as smooth, but it works.

---

## Finding Copilot in Word

Once you have a Copilot subscription, you'll see:

1. **Copilot button** in the Home tab (ribbon)
2. **Copilot icon** that appears when you select text
3. **Draft with Copilot** option in empty documents

If you don't see Copilot, check:
- Your Microsoft 365 subscription is active
- Your Copilot subscription is active
- You're signed in with the right account
- Word is updated to the latest version

### 1. Draft New Content

Start with an empty document or place your cursor where you want new content.

**How to use:**
1. Click the Copilot icon or press Alt+I
2. Type what you want: "Write a project proposal for..."
3. Copilot generates a draft
4. Keep it, regenerate, or adjust

**Example prompts:**

Write a 500-word executive summary for a quarterly sales report. 
Include sections for highlights, challenges, and next quarter outlook.
```

```
Draft a professional email to a client explaining a project delay. 
Tone: apologetic but confident. Include proposed new timeline.
```

```
Create an outline for a training document about our new CRM system.
Target audience: sales team with no technical background.
```

### 2. Rewrite Selected Text

Already have text but it's not quite right? Select it and let Copilot improve it.

**How to use:**
1. Select the text you want to change
2. Click the Copilot icon that appears
3. Choose "Rewrite" or type specific instructions
4. Review suggestions and accept or modify

**What you can ask:**

- "Make this more concise"
- "Make this more formal"
- "Make this more engaging"
- "Simplify for a general audience"
- "Make this sound more confident"
- "Fix the grammar and flow"

### 3. Summarize Documents

Have a long document? Get the key points fast.

**How to use:**
1. Open the Copilot pane (click Copilot in ribbon)
2. Ask: "Summarize this document"
3. Or be specific: "What are the main recommendations in this report?"

**Useful summary prompts:**

```
Summarize this document in 5 bullet points
```

```
What are the key action items mentioned?
```

```
List all deadlines mentioned in this document
```

```
What questions does this document leave unanswered?
```

### 4. Chat About Your Document

Ask questions, get explanations, find specific information.

**How to use:**
1. Open the Copilot pane
2. Ask questions about your document
3. Copilot responds with context from your content

**Example questions:**

```
What's the main argument in section 3?
```

```
Are there any inconsistencies between the introduction and conclusion?
```

```
Find all mentions of "budget" in this document
```

```
What data sources are cited?
```

## Prompting Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific About Format

**Vague:** "Write about our product"

**Better:** "Write a 300-word product description for our project management software. Include: key features (3-4 bullets), target audience, and a compelling opening line. Tone: professional but approachable."

### Include Context

Copilot knows what's in your document, but not what's in your head.

**Add context like:**
- Who will read this
- What you're trying to achieve
- Any constraints (length, tone, format)
- Examples of what you want

### Use Two-Step Prompting

For complex tasks, break it down:

**Step 1:** "Create an outline for a proposal about switching to remote work"

**Step 2:** "Now expand section 2 into full paragraphs"

### Ask for Options

"Give me 3 different opening paragraphs for this report" works better than asking for one perfect version.

## What Copilot Does Well

✅ **First drafts** — Gets you past the blank page fast

✅ **Rewriting** — Great for fixing awkward phrasing

✅ **Tone adjustment** — Formal ↔ casual conversions

✅ **Summarizing** — Quick extraction of key points

✅ **Formatting suggestions** — Tables, bullets, structure

✅ **Brainstorming** — "Give me 5 ways to open this proposal"

---

## What Copilot Struggles With

❌ **Highly creative writing** — Tends toward generic

❌ **Very long documents** — Better for sections than whole books

❌ **Specialized jargon** — May not know your industry's terms

❌ **Factual accuracy** — Don't trust statistics or claims without verification

❌ **Your voice** — Needs training to match your style

## Copilot vs. Alternatives

| Task | Copilot | ChatGPT | Claude |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| In-Word convenience | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ (copy/paste) | ⭐ (copy/paste) |
| Writing quality | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Long documents | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Speed | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Price | $20/mo + M365 | Free / $20/mo | Free / $20/mo |

**The verdict:** Use Copilot for quick edits and drafts within Word. Use Claude or ChatGPT for important writing where quality matters most.

**Many people use both:** Copilot for convenience, ChatGPT/Claude for quality.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Windows | Mac |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Open Copilot | Alt + I | ⌘ + I |
| Copilot pane | Click ribbon button | Click ribbon button |

---

## Privacy & Data

**What Microsoft says:**
- Your prompts and document content are processed by Azure OpenAI
- Enterprise customers: data isn't used to train models
- Consumer (Copilot Pro): check current privacy policy

**Best practices:**
- Don't use for highly confidential documents without checking your org's policy
- Enterprise/business licenses have stronger data protections
- When in doubt, use the free Copilot website instead (still requires caution)

---

## Is Copilot Worth $20/Month?

**Yes, if you:**
- Write in Word daily
- Value time over perfection
- Already have Microsoft 365
- Do lots of emails, reports, proposals

**No, if you:**
- Rarely use Word
- Need highest quality writing (use Claude instead)
- Are on a tight budget (free ChatGPT + copy/paste works)
- Mostly do creative writing

**Try it:** Microsoft often offers a 1-month trial. Test it on your actual work before committing.
