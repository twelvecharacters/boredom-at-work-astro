faq:
  - question: "What is the best free crypto portfolio tracker?"
    answer: "CoinGecko is the best free crypto portfolio tracker. It covers over 15,000 coins with real-time prices, lets you create multiple portfolios without an account, and doesn't require connecting any exchange APIs. CoinMarketCap is a close second with similar free features and coverage of 20,000+ coins — though it's owned by Binance, which matters if data neutrality is important to you."
  - question: "Do I need a crypto portfolio tracker if I only use one exchange?"
    answer: "If you literally only hold crypto on a single exchange, the exchange's built-in dashboard might be enough. But the moment you add a second exchange, a hardware wallet, any DeFi positions, or NFTs, a dedicated tracker becomes essential. It consolidates everything into one view so you can see your actual total portfolio value, real P&L, and allocation breakdown — instead of logging into five different apps."
  - question: "Which crypto portfolio tracker is best for tax reporting?"
    answer: "Koinly is the best overall for crypto tax reporting, supporting 400+ exchanges and generating tax reports for 20+ countries including IRS Form 8949 for the US. Paid plans start at $49/year. If you're specifically in the US and use TurboTax, CoinTracker is the better choice — it has a direct TurboTax integration and generates IRS-ready forms. CoinTracker's paid plans start at ~$29/year."

> **Disclaimer:** This article reviews crypto portfolio tracking tools for educational purposes. Nothing here is financial advice. Cryptocurrency is volatile and involves significant risk. Always do your own research before investing.

There's a specific kind of anxiety that comes from having crypto spread across four different exchanges, two wallets, and a DeFi protocol you connected at 11 PM on a Tuesday — and having absolutely no idea what your actual portfolio is worth.

That was me for about six months. I'd check Coinbase, then Binance, then my MetaMask, do some mental math, refresh everything, and somehow end up with a different number every time. All while pretending to review a spreadsheet at work.

So I tested every major crypto portfolio tracker I could find. Connected wallets, imported CSVs, compared free tiers, tried the premium plans. Some were genuinely impressive. Others were basically a worse version of a spreadsheet I could build myself.

Here are the seven that are actually worth using — whether you're casually holding some Bitcoin or knee-deep in DeFi yield farms you forgot about.

## 1. CoinGecko — Best Free Tracker

**Price:** Free (Premium ~$8/mo billed annually) | **Exchanges:** Manual entry | **Coins:** 15,000+

If you just want to track what you own without connecting anything, CoinGecko is the answer. It's the tracker I recommend to anyone who says "I just want to see my portfolio in one place without giving away my API keys."

**What makes it special:**

CoinGecko tracks over 15,000 cryptocurrencies with real-time pricing data. You can create a portfolio without even making an account — just add your holdings manually and watch the numbers move. It's also one of the most respected independent data aggregators in crypto, which matters when you realize CoinMarketCap is owned by Binance.

**Key features:**

- Multiple portfolios (group by strategy, chain, or theme)
- Price alerts on individual tokens
- Sort by market cap, volume, 24h change, or custom metrics
- Portfolio P&L tracking with percentage breakdowns
- Available on web, iOS, and Android
- No exchange API connections required

**The catch:** Everything is manual. You add transactions by hand, which means CoinGecko won't auto-sync your trades. If you're making dozens of trades a week, this gets tedious fast. But if you're more of a buy-and-hold person who makes a few moves a month, manual entry is honestly fine — and you never have to worry about API security.

**CoinGecko Premium** (~$8/mo annually) removes ads, adds exclusive reports and e-books, but the core portfolio tracker is completely free.

**Best for:** Casual holders who want a clean, independent tracker without connecting exchange accounts.

---

## 2. CoinMarketCap — Best for Market Overview

**Price:** Free | **Exchanges:** API + on-chain addresses | **Coins:** 20,000+

CoinMarketCap is the website every crypto person has open in a browser tab at all times. It's the default place people go to check prices, and its portfolio tracker is a solid — if basic — addition to that core experience.

**What makes it special:**

CMC tracks over 20,000 coins and tokens, making it the largest crypto database available. Unlike CoinGecko, you can connect exchange accounts via API and add on-chain wallet addresses that update automatically. The portfolio feature is completely free with no paywalled tiers.

**Key features:**

- Automatic syncing via exchange APIs and on-chain wallet addresses
- Filter portfolio by blockchain network
- Multiple portfolios per account
- Watchlists separate from portfolio (bookmark coins you're watching)
- Comprehensive market data (dominance charts, fear & greed index, trending coins)
- Web and mobile apps

**The catch:** It's owned by Binance (acquired in 2020), which raises questions about data neutrality. Some users have noted that Binance-listed coins occasionally appear more prominently. If that doesn't bother you, the tool itself is perfectly functional. It also lacks tax reporting and advanced DeFi tracking.

**Best for:** Anyone who already uses CoinMarketCap for market data and wants a simple portfolio view alongside it.

## 3. CoinStats — Best All-in-One Tracker

**Price:** Free (limited) / Premium ~$4/mo / Degen ~$63/mo | **Exchanges:** 300+ | **Coins:** 5,000+

CoinStats is what happens when someone tries to build the one tracker to rule them all. It connects to over 300 exchanges and wallets, tracks DeFi positions across 1,000+ protocols, handles NFTs, and even has built-in swap and tax reporting features.

**What makes it special:**

The sheer breadth of connections. CoinStats supports 300+ wallets and exchanges, 1,000+ DeFi protocols, and 100+ blockchains. If you've got crypto scattered across a dozen platforms, this is probably the fastest way to see it all in one dashboard. It also has a built-in swap feature and tax reporting tools.

**Key features:**

- Auto-sync from 300+ exchanges and wallets
- DeFi position tracking across 1,000+ protocols
- NFT portfolio tracking
- Built-in swap and earn features
- Tax reporting tools
- Price alerts and news feed
- Lock screen and home screen widgets (mobile)
- Read-only API connections (no withdrawal access)

**Pricing breakdown:**

- **Free:** Limited portfolios and daily syncs
- **Premium (~$4/mo billed annually at ~$36/yr):** 100 portfolios, 100,000 transactions, 200 daily syncs per portfolio
- **Degen (~$63/mo or ~$755/yr):** 500 portfolios, 1,000,000 transactions, unlimited daily syncs, VIP support

CoinStats also offers a 7-day free trial for the yearly Premium plan.

**The catch:** The free tier is quite limited. You'll hit sync limits quickly if you're active. And while having swap and earn features built into a tracker is convenient, purists might prefer keeping their tracking tool separate from anything that can move funds.

**Best for:** Active traders and DeFi users who want everything — portfolio, DeFi, NFTs, swaps, tax — in one app.

## 4. Delta — Best Mobile App

**Price:** Free / PRO ~$100/yr / PRO+ (higher tier) | **Exchanges:** 300+ | **Multi-asset:** Yes

Delta (now owned by eToro) has the cleanest mobile experience of any tracker I tested. It's the one I actually enjoy opening on my phone — which says a lot for a finance app.

**What makes it special:**

Delta isn't just a crypto tracker. It tracks stocks, ETFs, forex, commodities, and crypto in one app. If you want to see your Vanguard ETFs next to your Bitcoin next to your EUR/USD position, Delta does that. The UI is genuinely beautiful, and the app feels fast and responsive.

**Key features:**

- Multi-asset tracking (crypto, stocks, ETFs, forex, futures, commodities)
- Auto-sync from 300+ crypto exchanges and wallets
- AI-powered "What's going on?" portfolio analysis (PRO/PRO+)
- Custom watchlists and price alerts
- Available on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac
- Up to 5 devices on the free plan

**Pricing breakdown:**

- **Basic (Free):** Unlimited broker connections, up to 5 devices
- **PRO (~$100/yr or ~$14/mo):** AI insights, advanced analytics, more features
- **PRO+:** Professional-level depth with additional data and speed

**The catch:** Tax reporting isn't built in. You'll need a separate tool like Koinly or CoinTracker for that. And since eToro acquired Delta, some users worry about data sharing with a brokerage — though Delta still operates as a standalone app.

**Best for:** Mobile-first users who want a premium-feeling app that tracks crypto alongside traditional investments.

## 5. Koinly — Best for Tax Reporting

**Price:** Free (no report exports) / $49-279/yr | **Exchanges:** 400+ | **Countries:** 20+

Tax season with crypto is a nightmare. I say this as someone who once tried to manually calculate cost basis across three exchanges and two wallets. Koinly exists to make that specific nightmare go away.

**What makes it special:**

Koinly supports over 400 exchanges and wallets, auto-matches internal transfers (so sending BTC from Coinbase to your Ledger doesn't count as a taxable event), and generates tax reports for 20+ countries. It produces IRS Form 8949, UK HMRC reports, and country-specific formats for Canada, Australia, Germany, and more.

**Key features:**

- Import via API, CSV, or blockchain address for 400+ exchanges
- Auto-detection of transfers, airdrops, staking rewards, and DeFi transactions
- Tax-loss harvesting tool (identifies opportunities to offset gains)
- Supports 20,000+ cryptocurrencies
- Tax reports for 20+ countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, etc.)
- TurboTax-compatible exports
- Portfolio tracking dashboard with P&L

**Pricing breakdown:**

- **Free:** Unlimited transactions for portfolio tracking, but no tax report downloads
- **Newbie ($49/yr):** Up to 100 transactions, tax report downloads
- **HODLer ($99/yr):** Up to 1,000 transactions
- **Trader ($179/yr):** Up to 3,000 transactions
- **Pro ($279/yr):** Up to 10,000 transactions plus priority support

**The catch:** The free tier lets you import everything and see your portfolio, but you can't download the actual tax report without paying. So it's essentially a "try before you buy" — you can verify it handles your data correctly before committing. Fair enough, but annoying if you assumed "free" meant the whole thing.

**Best for:** Anyone who needs crypto tax reports, especially outside the US where options are more limited.

---

## 6. CoinTracker — Best for US Tax Filing

**Price:** Free (limited) / $29-599/yr | **Exchanges:** 500+ | **DApps:** 20,000+

If you're specifically in the United States and you file with TurboTax, CoinTracker is built for you. It has a direct integration with TurboTax that lets you import your crypto tax data without manual CSV juggling.

**What makes it special:**

The TurboTax partnership is the headline feature. CoinTracker generates IRS-ready forms (Form 8949, Schedule D) and can push them directly into TurboTax or H&R Block. It also supports 500+ exchanges and wallets, plus over 20,000 DeFi smart contracts.

**Key features:**

- Direct TurboTax and H&R Block integration
- IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D generation
- 500+ exchange and wallet connections
- 20,000+ DeFi protocol and smart contract support
- Tax-loss harvesting (Prime tier and above)
- Multiple cost-basis methods (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO, etc.)
- Portfolio tracking with P&L

**Pricing breakdown:**

- **Free:** Unlimited transactions for portfolio view, no tax form downloads
- **Base (~$29/yr):** Up to 100 transactions with tax exports
- **Base+ (~$99/yr):** Up to 250 transactions
- **Prime (~$199/yr):** Up to 1,000 transactions + tax-loss harvesting
- **Prime+ (~$299/yr):** Up to 2,500 transactions
- **Ultra ($599/yr):** High-volume traders

**The catch:** It's US-focused. While it works in other countries, the TurboTax integration — its biggest selling point — is obviously US-only. Also, the per-transaction pricing tiers can get expensive fast if you're an active trader. At 2,500+ transactions, you're looking at $300-600/year.

Note: if you have more than 4,000 transactions in a tax year, the direct TurboTax Online sync won't work — you'll need to download a grouped file instead.

**Best for:** US-based crypto holders who file with TurboTax and want the smoothest tax experience possible.

## 7. Zerion — Best for DeFi Tracking

**Price:** Free (most features) / Premium $99/yr | **Chains:** 40+ | **DeFi Protocols:** 500+

If your crypto life revolves around DeFi — yield farming, liquidity pools, staking, bridging — Zerion is built specifically for you. It's wallet-based rather than exchange-based, which is exactly how DeFi works.

**What makes it special:**

Zerion tracks across 40+ blockchains and 500+ DeFi protocols, showing you every LP position, staked token, and reward claim in one dashboard. It's not just a tracker either — it has a built-in DEX aggregator for swapping and bridging, so you can act on what you see without switching apps.

**Key features:**

- Wallet-based tracking across 40+ EVM-compatible blockchains
- 500+ DeFi protocol support (Aave, Uniswap, Curve, Lido, etc.)
- NFT portfolio tracking and management
- Built-in DEX aggregator (sources best swap prices)
- Historical P&L tracking
- Browser extension (4.7/5 on Chrome Web Store)
- Mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Transaction history CSV export (Premium)

**Pricing breakdown:**

- **Free:** Full DeFi tracking, wallet management, swaps, NFT viewing
- **Premium ($99/yr):** P&L for any token position, CSV transaction exports, reduced trading fee (0.4% vs 0.8%), premium perks

The subscription doesn't auto-renew, which is a refreshingly honest approach.

**The catch:** Zerion is wallet-only. If your crypto is on centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance), Zerion can't see it. You'd need to pair it with another tracker for your exchange holdings. It also doesn't generate tax reports — you'll need Koinly or CoinTracker for that.

**Best for:** DeFi-native users who live in MetaMask and want deep visibility into on-chain positions across multiple chains.

## Why Use a Crypto Portfolio Tracker?

If you're holding crypto on a single exchange and nothing else, you probably don't need one. But the moment any of these apply, a tracker becomes essential:

**Multiple exchanges.** You bought ETH on Coinbase, BTC on Kraken, and some altcoins on Binance. Without a tracker, you're logging into three separate apps to see your total value.

**Self-custody wallets.** Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) and software wallets (MetaMask, Phantom) don't show you a combined portfolio view. A tracker pulls it all together.

**DeFi positions.** Yield farming, liquidity pools, staking — these positions are spread across protocols on different chains. Good luck manually tracking your LP rewards on Uniswap V3 plus your staked ETH on Lido plus your Aave lending position.

**NFTs.** If you own NFTs across Ethereum, Solana, and other chains, a tracker that supports NFTs shows you their current floor prices alongside your fungible tokens.

**Tax reporting.** Every swap, trade, and token sale is a potentially taxable event. Manually tracking cost basis across hundreds of transactions is a recipe for mistakes — and IRS penalties.

**Real-time alerts.** Set price alerts for specific tokens, get notified when your portfolio crosses certain thresholds, or track when whale wallets move large amounts.

## How to Choose a Crypto Tracker

Not all trackers serve the same purpose. Here's what to consider:

### Exchange and Wallet Support

The tracker is only useful if it connects to where your crypto actually is. Check that it supports your specific exchanges and wallet types. Most major trackers support Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken — but less common exchanges or specific blockchain wallets might not be covered.

### DeFi and NFT Tracking

If you're deep in DeFi, you need a tracker that understands LP tokens, staking positions, and protocol-specific mechanics. CoinStats and Zerion are the strongest here. If you just hold tokens on exchanges, this doesn't matter.

### Tax Features

If you need tax reports, narrow your choices to Koinly (best multi-country), CoinTracker (best US/TurboTax), or CoinStats (basic tax tools). The free trackers (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) don't do tax.

### Privacy Considerations

Some trackers require exchange API connections. Always verify they use **read-only** API keys (no withdrawal permissions). CoinGecko's manual-only approach is the most private — nothing is connected, nothing can be compromised.

Also consider who owns the tracker. CoinMarketCap is owned by Binance. Delta is owned by eToro. If data independence matters to you, CoinGecko (independent) or open-source options might be preferable.

### Free vs Paid

For basic portfolio tracking, the free tiers of CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Zerion are genuinely useful without paying. The moment you need tax reports, advanced analytics, or high-volume DeFi tracking, expect to pay $30-300/year depending on your transaction volume.

---

## The Bored at Work Angle

Let's be honest — checking your crypto portfolio at work is a time-honored tradition. Here's how to do it discreetly:

**Browser tabs.** CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap both look like "financial research" if anyone glances at your screen. Much more professional than having Binance open with a trading interface.

**Mobile widgets.** CoinStats and Delta both offer lock screen and home screen widgets. A quick glance at your phone shows your portfolio value without opening an app. Looks exactly like checking a notification.

**Price alerts over constant checking.** Set alerts for meaningful price movements instead of refreshing every ten minutes. Your phone buzzes when something actually happens, and you spend the rest of your time doing [productive things at work](/productive-things-bored-at-work/) instead.

**Desktop apps.** Delta has a desktop app for Windows and Mac. It sits in your taskbar and looks like any other productivity tool. Way less suspicious than a crypto exchange in your browser.

The key is replacing the compulsive checking habit with smart alerts. Set your thresholds, trust the notifications, and get back to whatever you're supposedly working on.

---

## My Recommendation by Use Case

**"I just want to see my portfolio for free"** — Start with **CoinGecko**. No account needed, no API connections, independent data. Add your holdings manually and check prices whenever you want.

**"I want auto-syncing from my exchanges"** — Go with **CoinStats** (most connections) or **CoinMarketCap** (free with API support). CoinStats is better if you also need DeFi and tax features.

**"I'm mostly in DeFi and on-chain"** — **Zerion** is the clear winner. 40+ chains, 500+ protocols, and a built-in DEX aggregator. Pair it with CoinGecko for any centralized exchange holdings.

**"I need tax reports"** — **Koinly** for international (20+ countries) or **CoinTracker** for US specifically (TurboTax integration). Import everything, verify the numbers, then pay for the tax export.

**"I want the best mobile experience"** — **Delta** by eToro. Clean UI, multi-asset support (crypto + stocks + ETFs), AI-powered insights on PRO. Works across iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac.

**"I want everything in one place"** — **CoinStats** comes closest to doing it all — exchange syncing, DeFi, NFTs, swaps, tax, and alerts. The Premium plan at ~$4/month is reasonable for what you get.

Whatever you pick, the important thing is consolidating your portfolio view into one place instead of logging into five different apps throughout the day. Your blood pressure (and your productivity) will thank you.
