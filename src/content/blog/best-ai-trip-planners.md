## 3. ChatGPT - Best for Custom Planning

**What it is**: OpenAI's general-purpose AI, adaptable to travel planning.

## Special Needs: Dietary Restrictions

If you have celiac disease, food allergies, or specific dietary needs, AI tools can help—but some are better than others.

**Best for dietary research:**
- **Perplexity** - Can find recent experiences from people with your exact condition
- **Claude** - Gives nuanced, honest advice about what's safe and what isn't
- **ChatGPT** - Good for creating restaurant cards and translation phrases

**Key dietary prompts:**
```
I have [condition] and am traveling to [destination].
Which local dishes are naturally safe?
What hidden ingredients should I watch for?
Create phrases in the local language to explain my needs.
```

**Real trip reports with dietary restrictions:**
- [My Malaysia Trip with ChatGPT](/chatgpt-malaysia-trip-planning/) — 2 weeks, gluten-free, zero issues
- [AI-Planned London Weekend](/ai-planned-london-weekend/) — Clawd.bot found 3 celiac-safe restaurants
- [Claude-Planned Dubai Trip](/claude-planned-dubai-trip/) — 3 days, filmed hands-free with [Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses](/ray-ban-meta-review/)

---

## Our Recommended Workflow

After testing all these tools, here's the workflow we recommend:

1. **Brainstorm with ChatGPT or Claude** - Get destination ideas and rough plans
2. **Build your itinerary in Mindtrip or Wanderlog** - Organize and get real prices
3. **Verify with Google** - Check opening hours, distances, recent reviews
4. **Book through trusted sites** - Use the AI's suggestions but book directly
5. **For dietary needs** - Use Perplexity to find recent traveler experiences

This hybrid approach gives you AI creativity plus real-world accuracy.
