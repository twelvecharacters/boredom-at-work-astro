faq:
  - question: "Do I need a Thunderbolt dock or is USB-C enough?"
    answer: "For most home office workers, a standard USB-C dock is enough. USB-C docks support a single 4K display, charge your laptop, and connect peripherals—all through one cable. You only need Thunderbolt 4 if you want to run dual 4K monitors natively, transfer large files regularly (40Gbps vs 10Gbps), or daisy-chain devices. Thunderbolt docks cost $100-200 more, so only pay the premium if you actually need the extra bandwidth."
  - question: "Can I use two monitors with a MacBook Air or base MacBook Pro?"
    answer: "Not natively—Apple's base M1/M2/M3/M4 chips only support one external display over USB-C or Thunderbolt. To get dual monitors, you need a DisplayLink dock like the UGREEN Revodok Pro 209 or Anker 563, which uses a software driver to bypass Apple's hardware limitation. It works well for office tasks like documents, spreadsheets, and video calls, but is not ideal for color-critical work or video editing due to the compression involved."
  - question: "How much power delivery do I need from a docking station?"
    answer: "It depends on your laptop. Most 13-14 inch ultrabooks (MacBook Air, Dell XPS 13, ThinkPad X1) need 60-65W to charge at full speed. Larger 15-16 inch laptops (MacBook Pro 16, Dell XPS 15) need 90-100W. If the dock delivers less than your laptop requires, it will still charge—just slowly, and it may drain while under heavy load. Look for at least 85W PD if you have a standard work laptop, or 96W+ for larger machines."

If you work from a laptop at home, a docking station is the upgrade that ties everything together. One cable plugs into your laptop and suddenly you have your monitor, keyboard, mouse, webcam, Ethernet, and charging all connected. Unplug that one cable at the end of the day and you're mobile again.

But shopping for a dock in 2026 is confusing. Thunderbolt 4, USB-C, USB4, DisplayLink—the terminology alone is enough to make you close the browser tab. And prices range from $25 to $500, which doesn't help narrow things down.

I researched the most recommended docking stations across categories and budgets. Here are the 7 best picks, plus an honest breakdown of what you actually need.

## Thunderbolt 4 vs USB-C vs DisplayLink: What You Actually Need

This is where most people get confused, so let me break it down simply.

### USB-C (DP Alt Mode)

This is what most laptop USB-C ports support. A USB-C dock uses your laptop's built-in graphics to output video. It's straightforward: plug in the dock, your laptop sends video, data, and receives power through that one cable.

**Limitations:** Typically supports one 4K display at 60Hz. Bandwidth is shared between video, data, and peripherals, so connecting a lot of devices can create bottlenecks.

**Best for:** Most people. If you use one external monitor and a few peripherals, USB-C is all you need.

### Thunderbolt 4

Thunderbolt 4 uses the same USB-C connector (yes, the same physical plug) but guarantees 40Gbps bandwidth—roughly 4x more than standard USB-C. This means dual 4K displays at 60Hz, faster data transfers, and more headroom for peripherals.

**Limitations:** Your laptop needs a Thunderbolt 4 port (check your specs). Thunderbolt docks cost $100-200 more than USB-C equivalents.

**Best for:** Power users with dual monitors, external storage, and multiple high-bandwidth peripherals. Also required for daisy-chaining monitors.

### DisplayLink

DisplayLink is a software-based solution that compresses and sends video data over a standard USB connection. It installs a driver on your system and uses your CPU (not GPU) to process the display output.

**Why it matters:** DisplayLink is the only way to run dual or triple monitors on base-model Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4), which natively support only one external display. It's also cheaper than Thunderbolt.

**Limitations:** Slight image compression (barely noticeable for office work, but not ideal for photo/video editing). Uses some CPU resources. Requires a driver installation.

**Best for:** MacBook Air and base MacBook Pro users who need multiple monitors. Also great as a budget multi-monitor solution on any laptop.

### The Quick Decision

- **One monitor + basic peripherals** → USB-C dock ($25-200)
- **Dual 4K monitors + lots of peripherals** → Thunderbolt 4 dock ($300-400)
- **Multiple monitors on a MacBook Air/base Pro** → DisplayLink dock ($150-250)

## The 7 Best Docking Stations for Home Office

### 1. CalDigit TS4 — Best Overall

**~$380 | Thunderbolt 4 | 18 Ports | 98W PD**

The CalDigit TS4 has been the gold standard for Thunderbolt docks since it launched, and nothing has really knocked it off that throne. With 18 ports—the most of any Thunderbolt 4 dock—it handles virtually any setup you can throw at it.

**What makes it special:**

- **18 ports total**: 3 Thunderbolt 4 (40Gbps), 3 USB-C (10Gbps), 5 USB-A (10Gbps), DisplayPort 1.4, 2.5GbE Ethernet, SD + microSD (UHS-II), front + rear audio
- **Dual display support**: up to two 6K@60Hz monitors or one 8K@30Hz via Thunderbolt ports
- **98W Power Delivery** — charges MacBook Pro 14" at full speed, MacBook Pro 16" at near-full
- **2.5 Gigabit Ethernet** — faster than most docks' standard Gigabit
- **All USB ports are 10Gbps** — no sneaky USB 2.0 ports hidden in the back
- **Solid aluminum build** — sits vertical or horizontal, no wobble

The TS4's one notable absence is a dedicated HDMI port. You'll need a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI cable or adapter if your monitor doesn't have DisplayPort or USB-C input. For most modern monitors, this isn't an issue—but check your monitor's inputs before buying.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who wants the best dock money can buy and has a Thunderbolt 4 laptop. Especially great for MacBook users—it's practically the default recommendation in the Mac community for a reason.

### 2. Plugable TBT4-UDZ — Best for Multi-Monitor Setups

**~$300 | Thunderbolt 4 | 16 Ports | 98W PD**

If you need to drive more than two monitors, the Plugable TBT4-UDZ is the dock to look at. On Windows, it supports up to four 4K@60Hz displays simultaneously. On Mac (with M-series Pro/Max chips), you get dual 4K@60Hz.

**Key specs:**

- **16 ports**: Thunderbolt 4 host, USB-C 10Gbps, 2 HDMI + 2 DisplayPort outputs, 3 USB-A (10Gbps + 5Gbps), 2.5GbE Ethernet, SD + microSD, audio
- **Quad 4K display** on Windows — four monitors from a single dock
- **Dual 4K display** on Mac (M-series Pro/Max/Ultra chips)
- **98W Power Delivery** for laptop charging
- **2.5 Gigabit Ethernet**

The big advantage over the CalDigit TS4 is the dedicated HDMI and DisplayPort outputs—two of each. No adapters needed, no guessing. You plug in your monitors and they just work.

**The catch:** Base M1/M2/M3/M4 MacBooks (non-Pro/Max) are still limited to one external display natively. Plugable's drivers don't bypass that Apple limitation—you'd need a DisplayLink dock for that (see picks #5 and #6).

**Who it's for:** Windows power users who want quad-monitor setups, or Mac Pro/Max users who need dual 4K without compromises.

---

### 3. Dell Universal Dock UD22 — Best for Dell Laptop Users

**~$250 | USB-C with DisplayLink | 10 Ports | 96W PD**

The Dell UD22 is a universal dock that works with any USB-C laptop, but it's especially seamless with Dell systems. It uses DisplayLink technology to support up to four 4K displays from a single USB-C connection—no Thunderbolt required.

**What you get:**

- **10 ports**: 4 USB-A (10Gbps), 2 USB-C (10Gbps), 2 DisplayPort 1.2, 1 HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, 3.5mm combo audio
- **Up to quad 4K display** at 60Hz with DisplayLink drivers
- **96W Power Delivery** — handles most business laptops comfortably
- **130W power adapter** included
- **Compact and clean design** — typical Dell business aesthetic

The UD22 shines in corporate environments. Dell's driver integration is rock-solid on Dell laptops (auto-detected, often pre-installed), and the dock pairs perfectly with Dell monitors for a unified setup. It also works with MacBooks and other brands—you just need to install the DisplayLink driver manually.

**Who it's for:** Dell laptop users who want a plug-and-play experience, or anyone who needs multi-monitor support without paying Thunderbolt prices. Great for corporate WFH setups where IT standardizes on Dell hardware.

### 4. Anker 575 USB-C Docking Station (13-in-1) — Best Mid-Range

**~$200 | USB-C | 13 Ports | 85W PD**

The Anker 575 is the sweet spot between a basic USB-C hub and a full Thunderbolt dock. It gives you 13 ports including triple display output, 85W laptop charging, and SD card slots—all without requiring Thunderbolt.

**Key features:**

- **13 ports**: 2 HDMI, 1 DisplayPort, 3 USB-A, 1 USB-C (10Gbps), 1 USB-C (18W charging), Gigabit Ethernet, SD + microSD, 3.5mm audio, DC power input
- **Triple display** at 1080p@60Hz or dual display at 1440p@60Hz (via DP Alt Mode, not DisplayLink)
- **85W Power Delivery** for laptop charging + 18W USB-C for phone charging
- **135W power adapter** included

The display resolution is the main trade-off here. The Anker 575 uses your laptop's native DP Alt Mode for video output—no DisplayLink driver needed—but that means the bandwidth is split across monitors. Triple 4K isn't possible. If you need triple 1080p monitors or dual 1440p, it's great. If you need dual 4K, step up to a Thunderbolt dock.

**Who it's for:** Home office workers who want more ports than a basic hub but don't need (or want to pay for) Thunderbolt. The 13-port count and triple display make it a strong mid-range choice.

### 5. UGREEN Revodok Pro 209 — Best for MacBook Dual Monitors

**~$170 | USB-C with DisplayLink | 9 Ports | 100W PD**

This is the dock that solves Apple's most annoying limitation. If you have a MacBook Air or base MacBook Pro (M1/M2/M3/M4) and want two external monitors, the UGREEN Revodok Pro 209 uses DisplayLink to make it happen.

**What you get:**

- **9 ports**: 2 HDMI + 2 DisplayPort (mix and match for dual 4K@60Hz), USB-C (10Gbps), USB-A (10Gbps), 100W PD, Gigabit Ethernet
- **Dual 4K@60Hz** on any USB-C laptop, including base Apple Silicon Macs
- **100W Power Delivery** — charges even a MacBook Pro 16" adequately
- **10Gbps data ports** — no slow USB 2.0 compromises
- **DisplayLink driver required** — installs in minutes, runs in the background

At ~$170, it's significantly cheaper than any Thunderbolt dock that can do dual 4K. The trade-off is image quality: DisplayLink compresses the video signal, so there's a tiny quality loss compared to native Thunderbolt output. For documents, spreadsheets, Slack, email, and video calls, you genuinely will not notice. For color-critical design or video editing, stick with Thunderbolt.

**Who it's for:** MacBook Air and base MacBook Pro users who need dual monitors. Also a great affordable dual-4K dock for any USB-C laptop.

### 6. Anker 563 USB-C Docking Station (10-in-1) — Best Budget Full Dock

**~$150 | USB-C with DisplayLink | 10 Ports | 100W PD**

The Anker 563 takes the DisplayLink approach and pairs it with Anker's build quality and brand reliability. It supports triple displays (including on M-series Macs) and delivers 100W of charging power.

**Key specs:**

- **10 ports**: 2 HDMI, 1 DisplayPort, 3 USB-A (2x USB 2.0, 1x USB 3.1), 1 USB-C (5Gbps), Gigabit Ethernet, 3.5mm audio
- **Triple display support** on both Windows and Mac (via DisplayLink)
- **100W Power Delivery** for laptop + 30W USB-C port for phone
- **180W power adapter** included

The display resolution per monitor is lower than the UGREEN—4K@30Hz via HDMI plus 2048x1152@60Hz on the other outputs. For spreadsheets and documents, this is fine. If you specifically want dual 4K@60Hz, the UGREEN Revodok Pro 209 is the better pick.

Where the Anker 563 wins is the triple-display capability and the 30W phone charging port—handy if you want to charge your phone at your desk without a separate charger.

**Who it's for:** Budget-conscious home office workers who want a full docking experience with triple-monitor support. A great entry point into the "real dock" category.

### 7. Anker 332 USB-C Hub (5-in-1) — Best Compact / Travel

**~$25 | USB-C Hub | 5 Ports | 85W Pass-Through**

Sometimes you don't need 18 ports. You need one HDMI output, a couple of USB ports, and charging. The Anker 332 does exactly that, weighs 78 grams, and costs about $25.

**What you get:**

- **5 ports**: 1 HDMI (4K@30Hz), 1 USB-C (5Gbps), 2 USB-A (5Gbps), 1 USB-C PD pass-through (85W)
- **78 grams** — lighter than your phone
- **0.59 inches thick** — disappears into any bag
- **No external power needed** — bus-powered from your laptop
- **Plug and play** — no drivers, works with Mac/Windows/ChromeOS

The 4K@30Hz HDMI output is fine for a single monitor used for documents and web browsing—but if you do anything with motion (scrolling quickly, video playback), you'll want 4K@60Hz, which this hub doesn't support. For a desk-bound setup, consider one of the docks above. For travel, coworking spaces, conference rooms, and "I just need to connect a monitor real quick," it's perfect.

**Who it's for:** Anyone who needs a minimal, portable hub for travel or as a backup. Also great for workers who dock at the office (using a full dock there) but want something light for home or travel.

## Things to Check Before You Buy

### 1. Does Your Laptop Support Thunderbolt 4?

Not every USB-C port is Thunderbolt. Check your laptop's specs page or look for the Thunderbolt logo (a lightning bolt) next to the port. If your laptop only has standard USB-C, a Thunderbolt dock will still work—but only as a USB-C dock, losing the dual-display and bandwidth advantages.

### 2. How Much Power Does Your Laptop Need?

| Laptop Size | Typical Charging Wattage | Minimum PD to Look For |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 13-14" ultrabooks | 45-65W | 65W |
| 14-15" mainstream | 65-90W | 85W |
| 15-16" performance | 90-140W | 96W+ |

If the dock delivers less wattage than your laptop needs, it'll charge slowly—or drain under heavy workloads.

### 3. What Monitor Connections Do You Need?

Check your monitor's inputs before buying a dock. If you just upgraded to a [new work monitor](/best-monitors-working-from-home/), most modern 4K panels have HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C. Older monitors might only have HDMI. Make sure the dock's output matches your monitor's input—or budget $10-15 for an adapter.

### 4. Do You Need Ethernet?

WiFi is fine for most work. But if you do large file transfers, video calls that can't afford to stutter, or your WiFi is unreliable, built-in Ethernet on a dock is a real convenience. Most docks include Gigabit Ethernet; the CalDigit TS4 and Plugable TBT4-UDZ include 2.5GbE for faster local network speeds.
